\section*{Abstract}
Tree water use is central to plant function and ecosystem fluxes. However, it is still unknown how organ-level water relations traits are coordinated to determine whole-tree water use strategies in response to drought, and if this coordination depends on climate. Here we used a global sap flow data base (SAPFLUXNET) to study the response of water use, in terms of whole-tree canopy conductance ($G$), to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and to soil water content (SWC) for 142 tree species. We investigated the individual and coordinated effect of six water relations traits (vulnerability to embolism, Huber value, hydraulic conductivity, turgor-loss point, rooting depth and leaf size) on water use parameters, also accounting for the effect of tree height and climate (mean annual precipitation, MAP). Reference $G$ and its sensitivity to VPD were tightly coordinated with water relations traits rather than with MAP. Species with efficient xylem transport had higher canopy conductance but also higher sensitivity to VPD. Moreover, we found that angiosperms had higher reference $G$ and higher sensitivity to VPD than gymnosperms. Our results highlight the importance of trait coordination and the complications of defining a single, whole-plant resource use spectrum ranging from ‘acquisitive’ to ‘conservative’.\par

##Introduction
Plant water use is a key component of the global water cycle (@katul_evapotranspiration_2012). Plants regulate water use across a broad range of timescales to maintain a favourable water status under varying  water availability (@feng_reconciling_2017). This regulation is the result of evolutionary processes together with environmental and biophysical constraints that have determined a huge diversity of species-specific water use strategies mediated by a particular suite of traits (@Bacelar2012; @lu_optimal_2020). These specific strategies determine plant survival under drought (@mitchell_drought_2013), species coexistence (@ehleringer_differential_1991; @jackson_partitioning_1995) and ecosystem $\text{CO}_2$ and water fluxes (@mencuccinimodelling2019). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how regulation of whole-plant water use relates to organ-level water relations traits would allow for a better characterization of plant responses to drought and improved prediction of climate change impacts on vegetation (@anderegg_spatial_2015).\par

Among many other traits, the sensitivity of stomata to drought stress is a major regulator of plant water use over relatively short timescales (@martin-stpaul2017). In the absence of effective stomatal control under drought, water uptake by roots might not compensate water loss, resulting in high tensions in plants' vascular system, which can trigger the entrance of air bubbles leading to xylem embolism (@tyree_xylem_2002). If embolism spreads to most of the xylem conduits, water transport becomes restricted and plants may eventually die from hydraulic failure (@tyree_woody_1988; @choat_triggers_2018). Through stomatal closure, plants reduce whole-plant canopy conductance ($G$) and therefore water loss and embolism risk, and maintain water status within tolerable limits, at the expense, however, of reducing gas exchange. Plants close stomata in response to drops in leaf and/or soil water potentials (see @martinez-vilalta_water_2017) produced by increased atmospheric water demand (i.e., vapor pressure deficit; VPD) and reduced soil water availability (i.e., soil water content; SWC) (@jarvis_interpretation_1976; @grossiord_precipitation_2017). Stomatal responses have been largely described using semi-empirical models (@jarvis_interpretation_1976; @Oren1999; @Damour2010) and optimality approaches relying on the coupling of photosynthesis and  transpiration (@Wang2020), with a recent focus on plant hydraulics (@sperry_pragmatic_2016). Global syntheses of these two approaches exist (@lin_optimal_2015; @hoshika_global_2018) but they are only at the leaf level, and they do not consider the coordination of stomatal and hydraulic traits.\par 

Coordination among stomatal sensitivity and other hydraulic and allocation traits is thought to underlie differences in water use strategies among species (@meinzer_co-ordination_2002; @sperry_pragmatic_2016; @McCulloh2019). Because in woody plants water has to be transported from the soil through the xylem to supply leaf transpiration, the hydraulic properties of the xylem are key determinants of plant water relations and water use strategies. Particularly, maximum sapwood hydraulic conductivity ($K_\text{s}$; Table 5.1) and vulnerability to xylem embolism (usually quantified as $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$; i.e. the water potential at which half of $K_\text{s}$ is lost) are key determinants of maximum transpiration rates (@Manzoni2013). In addition, a vulnerable xylem (i.e. high |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|) has been related to higher canopy-level stomatal sensitivity to VPD across (@litvak_transpiration_2012) and within some species (@aspinwall_genetic_2011). $K_\text{s}$ and $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$ have been hypothesized to define a safety-efficiency trade-off at the tissue level, by which species with high $K_\text{s}$ (i.e., high water transport efficiency) are also more vulnerable to embolism (low |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$| and low safety) and vice versa (@venturas_plant_2017). However, this trade-off appears to be weak at the global scale across species, at least as captured with current measurement techniques (@gleason_weak_2016; @SanchezMartinez2020). At the leaf level, another key component is the water potential at turgor-loss point ($\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$), which is tightly associated with drought tolerance and habitat water availability (@bartlett_determinants_2012). $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ is also closely related to water potential at complete stomatal closure (@brodribb_stomatal_2003; @martin-stpaul2017), and thus can be used as a proxy for quantifying the sensitivity of plant water use to changes in water availability.\par



Allocation ratios between the organs involved in water loss, transport and uptake are also important determinants of water use strategies. The ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area or Huber value ($Hv$) is a major trait defining water use strategies because it expresses the water conducting area per unit transpiring area. Increased $Hv$ can contribute to reduce water potential gradients within the plant and therefore potentially compensate for a species vulnerable xylem (@mencuccini_leaf_2019). In addition, a high $Hv$ has also been associated to strict stomatal control in conifers (@martinez-vilalta_hydraulic_2004; @Poyatos2007) and to higher reference canopy conductance (@Novick2009). Similarly, increasing rooting depth ($R_{\text{depth}}$) gives access to deeper water sources, which potentially allows maintaining less negative and stable water potentials as well as supporting high water use even under climates with high evaporative demand (@martinez-vilalta_water_2017). At the leaf level, the importance of individual leaf size ($L_s$) for light penetration and crown architecture has been thoroughly studied (@Sellers1985), but its influence on water use strategies has been little explored, despite the role of leaf evaporative cooling for thermoregulation (@wright_global_2017). Large leaves with thick leaf boundary layers and an ineffective stomatal control of water loss (@jarvis_stomatal_1986), may need to sustain higher transpiration rates to maintain leaf temperature within operative limits under intense radiative heating and/or heat waves (e.g. @drake_trees_2018). This may lead to a trade-off between leaf thermoregulation and the conservation of water and/or hydraulic function (@fauset_differences_2018), especially in hotter sites (@aparecido_high_2020).\par

Water use strategies are also mediated by plant height, community composition, and environmental conditions, particularly climate, topography and soil properties; as well as spatial and temporal variability in environmental conditions (@feng_ecohydrological_2018). Plant height increases hydraulic path length and hydraulic resistance, and thus plays a major role in the global coordination of several water use traits such as $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$ or $K_\text{s}$ (@liu_hydraulic_2019), $Hv$ (@mencuccini_leaf_2019) and reference canopy conductance (@Novick2009). Likewise, increasing tree height has been related to enhanced sensitivity of canopy conductance to VPD for some species (@Schafer2000). Because soil water is a common resource belowground that is influenced by water uptake from many individuals and species, the community composition and diversity of water use strategies in an ecological community can also affect ecosystem fluxes and drought progression (@anderegg_hydraulic_2018, [-@anderegg_plant_2019]). In addition, phylogeny may constrain flexibility in water use strategies independently of the environment, as it has been shown for example by the consistent differences in hydraulic traits between angiosperms and gymnosperms (@johnson_hydraulic_2012; @bartlett_correlations_2016) and by the strong phylogenetic conservatism reported for some hydraulic traits such as $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$ and $K_\text{s}$ at the global scale (@SanchezMartinez2020).\par

In this study we explore water use strategies across tree species using a trait-based approach, which provides a simplified framework to understand species responses to drought at the global scale (@feng_ecohydrological_2018). Our ultimate aim is to better understand how water use strategies emerge from the covariation between traits and the influence of climate. To that end, we use a global database of sap flow measurements (SAPFLUXNET) to calculate whole-tree canopy conductance ($G$) for 142 tree species growing on 126 sites. We then parameterize the response of *G* to VPD and SWC at the species level and for major taxonomic groups (i.e. angiosperms and gymnosperms). Finally, we characterize the relationships between water use traits and key hydraulic and allocation traits among species (i.e. $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$, $K_\text{s}$, $Hv$, $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, $R_{\text{depth}}$, $L_s$ and tree height), controlling also for the climatic effects produced by differences in precipitation. We hypothesize that (i) water use and water relations traits are coordinated to determine water use strategies at the species level, and (ii) species occupying drier habitats will tend to be more ‘conservative’ in their water use and also tend to have drought tolerance traits. (iii) After controlling for climatic effects, a safety-efficiency trade-off is visible at the scale of whole-plant water use, as opposed to the scale of individual xylem conduits.\par


##Material and methods
We took a two-step approach to test the previous hypotheses. First, we modelled species-level whole-tree canopy conductance responses to evaporative demand and soil water availability to obtain species’ water use parameters, taking advantage of a recently-compiled global sap flow dataset. Next, we modelled the variability of those water use parameters as a function of species' water relations traits, mean annual precipitation (MAP), tree height and broad functional types (i.e., angiosperms and gymnosperms).\par

###Sap flow data
Data from 1929 trees belonging to 142 species on 126 plots without experimental treatments (Table D1) and meeting data quality criteria (see Data filtering section below) were obtained from the global SAPFLUXNET database (@poyatos_global_2020) (Fig. 5.1 and Table D2). For each species-site combination, we extracted sub-daily sap flux density (SFD; Table 5.1) or whole-tree sap flow (SF; 24 out of 126 data-sets) when tree sapwood areas (ASW) were not available. For these datasets, SF data were then transformed into SFD units by dividing SF values by tree ASW estimated with an allometric relationship. This relationship was obtained using all the SAPFLUXNET trees for which ASW data were available and taking diameter at breast height (DBH) and functional type (i.e., angiosperm or gymnosperm) as predictors ($R^2$ = 0.78; n = 2262). Sub-daily SFD time-series were aggregated to daytime SFD averages (i.e., 6am to 6pm solar time) using the sfn_metrics function of the sapfluxnetr R package (@granda_sapfluxnetr_2020). Time-series obtained from non-calibrated thermal dissipation sensors were corrected for potential bias in absolute SFD by applying a multiplier of 1.405, according to the global synthesis of sap flow calibrations by @Flo2019.\par

###Evaporative demand and soil water availability data
We used vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water content (SWC) as proxies of evaporative demand and soil water availability, respectively. Similar to SFD, VPD was obtained from on-site sub-daily measurements from SAPFLUXNET averaged to daytime values. Soil water content (SWC; v/v) was obtained from the 15-30 cm depth layer at 12 am from the ERA5-land re-analysis product (@copernicus_climate_change_service_c3s_c3s_2019) at 9x9 km resolution. We used ERA5-land re-analyses instead of on-site SWC measures in order to maximize the number of plots and species included in the study, since SWC data were missing in 44% of the SAPFLUXNET data-sets included in this study. In addition, ERA5-land had longer time series (1980 to 2019). We validated the use of ERA5-land data using a linear mixed-model (LMM) regression between ERA5-land and on-site shallow SWC measurements by letting random intercepts and slopes of the response vary by site (n observations = 32815; n plots = 71; $R^2$conditional = 0.97, $R^2$marginal = 0.26).\par

To complement SWC, we also calculated relative extractable water (REW), as a normalized measure of soil water availability, as follows:

\begin{equation}
REW_{j,i} = \frac{SWC_{j,i} - SWC_{min}}{SWC_{max} - SWC_{min}}
\end{equation}

where $REW_{j,i}$ and $SWC_{j,i}$ are plot ($j$) daily ($i$) values, and SWCmax and SWCmin, the overall maximum and minimum SWC measured at a plot, respectively. REW takes values between 0 and 1, being 0 the absolute plot lowest SWC and 1 being the highest.\par

###Data filtering
We restricted the analysis to periods without potential phenological changes in leaf area to minimize variations in conductance unrelated to VPD and SWC changes. In the absence of detailed plot-specific observations, we excluded all data for periods comprised between 15 days prior to the first day with temperatures below 0ºC and 30 days following the last day under 0ºC, respectively, during the cold seasons of each plot site (similarly to @Novick2016). To prevent potential artefacts due to unstable weather conditions in the calculation of whole-tree canopy conductance (@ewers_analyses_2000) or in the estimation of model parameters, we filtered out days when SWC increased (rainy days), as well as days when daytime-averaged VPD was below 0.3 kPa (@anderegg_hydraulic_2018). To ensure sufficiently contrasting conditions of evaporative demand and soil water availability, we also discarded species with both VPD ranges below 0.5 kPa and SWC ranges below 0.05 (n = 8 species).\par

After data filtering, the study covers a large geographic area \\fdash being Europe and the east of North America especially well represented (Fig. 5.1)\\fdash and a wide range of climate conditions, with MAP values ranging from 14 mm to 3626 mm (mean \\pm SD = 953 mm \\pm 545 mm). Out of the 142 species used in the analyses, 116 were angiosperms and 26 gymnosperms. The number of trees per species ranges from 215 trees (*Pinus sylvestris*) to 1 (this being the case for 23 species) (Table D2). Tree species-level heights (H) range from 2 m (*Coprosma quadrifida*) to 40 m (*Carya glabra*) (mean \\pm SD = 21 m \\pm 9.75 m).\par

###Whole-tree canopy conductance calculation
Daytime SFD was transformed from [$\text{cm}^3 \: \text{cm}_{\text{Asw}}^{-2} \: \text{h}^{-1}$] to [$\text{kg} \: \text{m}_{\text{Asw}}^{-2} \: \text{s}^{-1}$] and converted to daily whole-tree canopy conductance normalized per unit of sapwood area $G_{\text{Asw}}$$ using @phillips_comparison_1998 and unit transformations (eq. 5.2).

\begin{equation}
G_{Asw,j,i,k} = \frac{115.8 + 0.4236 \: T_{j , i} \cdot SFD_{j , i , k}}{VPD_{j,i}}\cdot \eta \cdot \frac{T_0}{(T_0 + T_{j,i})} \cdot \frac{P_0 \: e^{0.00012 \cdot h_i}}{P_0}
\end{equation}

Where  $SFD_{j,i,k}$ is the sap flux density value of each site ($j$), day ($i$), and tree ($k$); ${T}_{j,i}$ [ºC] is the temperature, $VPD_{j,i}$ [kPa] is the daytime vapour pressure deficit, $\eta$ equals 44.6 mol $\text{m}^{-3}$, $T_0$ is 273 K, $P_0$ is 101,325 Pa and $h$ [m] is the altitude of each site. When $h$ was not available it was obtained from The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (@earth_resources_observation_and_science_eros_center_shuttle_2017) (n = 2 plots).\par

The conductance obtained using eq. 5.2 is considered a good proxy of the tree-level stomatal conductance under the assumption that the canopy and the atmosphere are well-coupled, i.e., when the aerodynamic conductance is much larger than the stomatal conductance. Although this is generally assumed in sap flow studies for both needleleaf and even broadleaf species, there is evidence that coupling may only be partial in some cases (@magnani_modelling_1998; @de_kauwe_ideas_2017). Therefore, we also calculated whole-tree stomatal conductance ($G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$) by removing the contribution of aerodynamic conductance in a subset of plots-species (n plots = 64; n species = 47) where wind speed data were available in SAPFLUXNET (see appendix D notes for details, @chu_temporal_2018; @tan_surface_2019). We also related the environmental sensitivity of $G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$ to the hydraulic and allocation traits (see Statistical analyses section below) to assess the potential impact of partial canopy-atmosphere coupling on our results.\par

###Traits and climatic data
Species-level traits (|$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|, $Hv$, $K_\text{s}$, |$\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$|, $R_{\text{depth}}$ and $L_s$) were taken from HydraTry (@mencuccini_leaf_2019; @SanchezMartinez2020) and the Global Leaf Size Dataset (@wright_global_2017) (Table D2). |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|, $Hv$, $K_\text{s}$ and $L_s$ were log-transformed to achieve normality. In addition, we obtained tree species-level height (H) as the average of SAPFLUXNET actual tree heights, with the number of tree-days with available sap flow values as weighting factor. The height of the stand was used when the actual height of a tree was not available (792 out of 1929 trees).\par

To account for climatic effects on the species’ water use parameters and on water relation traits, we used mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT) and an aridity index defined as precipitation over potential evapotranspiration (PPET) (Fig. 5.1, Fig. D6, Fig. D7). However, for simplicity, we only included MAP in the analyses since for the species in the study MAP was strongly correlated with PPET ($r$ = 0.94) and MAT ($r$ = 0.76), whereas PPET and MAT correlation was lower ($r$ = 0.56). MAP and MAT were obtained for all study plots from the CHELSA data set (1x1 km resolution) (@karger_climatologies_2017) and averaged at the species level weighting by the number of tree-days. PPET were obtained from CGIAR-CSI Global Aridity index (@trabucco_global_2019).\par

###$\textbf{G}_{\textbf{Asw}}$ sensitivity to soil water availability and water demand
In some species, $G_{\text{Asw}}$ measurements were distributed very heterogeneously throughout the range of VPD or SWC. To avoid the issues associated with such unbalanced distributions we used binned data. Specifically, we calculated the average of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ measurements comprised into 0.2 kPa VPD intervals and five bins spanning the plot-species specific SWC range. For each summarized $G_{\text{Asw}}$ we defined a characteristic VPD and SWC as the average values of VPD and SWC of the data in the bin. The summarized values of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ were fitted using LMM as a function of the logarithm of VPD (ln(VPD)) and the logarithm of SWC (ln(SWC)) as additive explanatory variables using uncorrelated random slopes for each species and a random intercept for each tree nested in each species. We log-transformed the independent variables to linearise the relationships and ensure normal residuals. LMMs were fitted using the lmer function from the lme4 R package (@Bates2015). Using the coef function from lme4 we obtained species parameters $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ (i.e. species $G_{\text{Asw}}$ sensitivity to VPD and to SWC, respectively), with higher values of $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ or $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ meaning stronger *G* reductions with increasing VPD or decreasing SWC, respectively. In addition, a reference $G_{\text{Asw}}$ ($G_{\text{REF}}$) characterizing water use under standard conditions for each species, was predicted setting VPD = 1 kPa and SWC = 0.5 $\text{m}^3$ $\text{m}^{-3}$ (which is close to the average maximum of all sites). Complementary models were also fitted following the same procedure but with REW instead of SWC, so that soil water content variability was normalized across sites. Additional models were also fitted using canopy stomatal conductance ($G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$) as response variable. Finally, to remove parameter outliers, species with $G_{\text{REF}}$ ,  $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ or $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$  outside the 99.9 percentile of their normal distribution were excluded from subsequent analyses (2 out of 142 species excluded).\par

###Statistical analyses
We tested whether water use regulation traits ($G_{\text{REF}}$, $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) differ between angiosperms and gymnosperms using a simple linear model. Next, we constructed bi-variate linear relationships between species’ fitted parameters and species’ water relations traits. Furthermore, we repeated these linear relationships by adding MAP and H as predictors and applying a stepwise model selection, to discern whether the effect of the traits remained significant once these new variables were added to the model. In all the analyses we used the number of species’ tree-days as a weighting factor.\par

Finally, we performed a path analysis using the SEM function of the lavaan R package (@rosseel_lavaan_2012). Path analysis accounts for direct and indirect dependencies among variables. To account for the coordinated effect of the species’ relations traits and to maximize the number of species (106 species), we imputed species’ trait missing values (Table D2) using the imputePCA function of the package missMDA (@josse_missmda_2016) and then performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the two main principal components (Fig. D1). A single path model was built including the three parameters describing $G_{\text{Asw}}$ behaviour ($G_{\text{REF}}$, $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) as response variables and using MAP, $H$ and the two dimensions of the traits’ PCA as explanatory variables. In addition to direct relationships, indirect effects of MAP and $H$ on the fitted parameters were also included through their effect on the PCA dimensions (@liu_hydraulic_2019). We also accounted for the effect of MAP on $H$.  We included the number of tree-days per species as a weighting factor in the model. We performed a model selection procedure to include only paths with at least moderately strong support (P < 0.1). Finally, we also checked that the fit of the final model was not significantly different from the saturated model using the lavTestLRT function of the lavaan R package (@rosseel_lavaan_2012) with @satorra_scaled_2001 approximation. All variables were standardized before fitting the path models. All the analyses of the study were performed in R3.6.1 (@r_core_team_r_2018).\par

##Results
###Water use parameters and differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms
The model used to obtain water use parameters explained a 59.8% of the total conditional variance in the original data. Reference conductance ($G_{\text{REF}}$) across species ranged between 82.4 $mol\: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$ (*Juniperus monosperma*) and 333 $mol\: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$ (*Acacia longifolia*), $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ between -26 $mol\: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$  (*Avicennia marina*) and 306 $mol\: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$ (*Ulmus americana*) and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ between -17.3 $mol\: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$ (*Acer saccharum*) and 112 $mol \: m_{Asw}^{-2}\: s^{-1}$ (*Acacia longifolia*) (Fig. D2 – D3 – D4). Most species showed  declining *G* with increasing VPD (positive $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$) and increasing *G* with increasing SWC (positive $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$).\par

Species showing opposite responses were two temperate (*Acer saccharum*, *Quercus petraea*), one tropical (*Ampelocera macrocarpa*) and a mangrove (*Avicennia marina*) species that showed negative sensitivities to one of the variables (Fig. D2). Mean $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ were significantly higher for angiosperms than for gymnosperms (Fig. 5.2). However, there were no differences in $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ between angiosperms and gymnosperms. Across all species (including angiosperms and gymnosperms), $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ were strongly and positively correlated ($r$ = 0.75; with a weighted slope of 0.67; Fig. D5), being the species with high $G_{\text{REF}}$ more sensitive to VPD, but strong correlations were not found between $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ or between $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ (|$r$| < 0.34 in both cases). When comparing water use parameters calculated considering and not considering aerodynamic conductance, we found that $G_{\text{REF}}$ was strongly correlated to $G_{\text{REF}}^{'}$ ($r$ = 0.8); however, $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}^{'}$ were poorly correlated ($r$ = 0.26) while $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}^{'}$ showed no significant correlation.\par

###Coordination with hydraulic and allocation traits
In the bi-variate models relating $G_{\text{REF}}$ with hydraulic and morphological traits, we found that $G_{\text{REF}}$ showed a negative relationship with |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|, $Hv$ and |$\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$| (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.3(a,c,d)), whereby species more resistant to embolism, with higher allocation to the sapwood relative to leaves and with more negative turgor-loss pressures showed lower $G_{\text{REF}}$. Furthermore, $G_{\text{REF}}$ was positively related to $K_\text{s}$, $R_{\text{depth}}$ and $L_s$ (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.3(b,e,f)), with species with efficient xylem, deeper roots and bigger leaves showing higher $G_{\text{REF}}$. For these traits, $L_s$ was the one explaining the largest fraction of $G_{\text{REF}}$ variability ($R^2$ = 0.39). With the exception of $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, these relationships remained significant also for $G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$ (Table D3).\par

$\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ was negatively related with |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$| and $Hv$ and positively with $K_\text{s}$ (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.4(a,b,c)), i.e., species with less safe and more efficient xylem present higher sensitivity to VPD, and hence more strict stomatal control as atmospheric water demand increases. $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ was also positively related to $R_{\text{depth}}$ and $L_s$ (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.4(e,f)), indicating that deeper roots and larger leaves were associated to higher stomatal sensitivity to VPD. Absolute turgor-loss point (|$\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$|) was weakly negatively related with $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ (p value = 0.093; Table 5.2). $Hv$ and $L_s$ were the traits explaining most of $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ variability ($R^2$ = 0.36 and $R^2$ = 0.33, respectively). With the exception of $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, these relationships remained significant also for $G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$ (Table D3).\par

$\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ was positively related to |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$| and $Hv$ (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.5(a,c)), i.e., species with higher resistance to embolism and larger ratios of sapwood to leaf area were more sensitive to soil water depletion. In addition, species with larger leaves ($L_s$) and, marginally (p value = 0.095), with deeper roots ($R_{\text{depth}}$) were less sensitive to soil water stress (Table 5.2 and Fig. 5.5(e,f)). In general, water relations traits explained a lower proportion (at most 9%) of the variability in $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ than of $G_{\text{REF}}$ or $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$. However, we should treat relationships between $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ and |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|, $Hv$ and $R_{\text{depth}}$ with caution, since they all become non-significant when aerodynamic conductance was taken into account (Table D3) or when REW was used instead of SWC (Table D3). Furthermore, when REW was used instead of SWC, all soil moisture sensitivity-trait relationships became non-significant (Table D4).\par

Ecological factors associated with water use parameters and coordination
When the coordination between water use parameters and water relations traits was assessed while also accounting for the effects of MAP (mean annual precipitation) and $H$ (tree species-level mean height), most of the relationships described in the previous section remained significant, with only three exceptions. The relationships that were no longer observed corresponded to the effect of $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ on $G_{\text{REF}}$ and the effects of |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$| and $Hv$ on $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ (Table 5.3). In these models, MAP was the variable that explained most of the variability in stomatal responses to soil water ($\beta_{\text{SWC}}$), with generally lower sensitivity to SWC in locations with high MAP (Table 5.3), although this effect reversed in the $L_s$ model. However, when models were calculated using $\beta_{\text{SWC}}^{'}$, MAP effects were all negative (Table D5). On the other hand, MAP was largely unrelated to $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ in most of the $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ models (Table 5.3). Finally, our results show that taller trees tend to have higher $G_{\text{REF}}$ and higher sensitivity to VPD ($\beta_{\text{VPD}}$), however, when $G_{\text{REF}}$ was obtained from $G_{\text{Asw}}^{'}$ (i.e. $G_{REF}^{'}$), $H$ was not selected in the final models (Table D5). The relationship between $H$ and soil drought sensitivity ($\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) was less clear, since it was significantly negative in only two of the models (Table 5.3), suggesting higher sensitivity to soil drought in shorter trees. However when aerodynamic coupling was taken into account, the relationship was inverted and taller trees had higher sensitivity to SWC (Table D5).\par

The two main dimensions of the PCA analyses describing water relations trait coordination explained a 69.8% of the total variance (Fig. D1). The primary PCA dimension (Dim1; 56.8% of variance) could be interpreted as a safety-efficiency trade-off axis, whereby positive values are related to elevated $K_\text{s}$, large $L_s$, deep roots, low $Hv$ and low |$\Psi_{\text{P50}}$|. The second PCA dimension (Dim2; 13% of variance) was associated to leaf turgor-loss pressure ($\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$), with positive values related to high |$\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$| levels and, to a lower extent, deeper roots.\par

```{r ch5fig6, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%',fig.pos="hbt!", fig.align="center", fig.scap="Path analyses of species-specific water use parameters.", fig.cap="Path analyses of species-specific water use parameters explained by mean annual precipitation (MAP), tree height ($H$) and coordinated hydraulic traits Dim1.

Dim2 was not selected in the final model. Arrow labels are standardized parameters. Continuous lines are positive relationships while dashed lines are negative relationships.

knitr::include_graphics(path = "figure/CH5/Figure_6.pdf")
```

In the path analyses, efficiency traits (positive PCA Dim1 values) were significantly related to high annual precipitation (high MAP) and to taller trees (large $H$) (Fig. 5.6). Also, $H$ increased with MAP. $G_{\text{REF}}$ was positively associated with Dim1 (Fig. 5.6) and taller trees also had marginally higher $G_{\text{REF}}$ (Fig. 5.6). Similarly, higher $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ (i.e., higher VPD sensitivity) was positively related to efficient water transport (Dim1) and to $H$ (Fig. 5.6). Sensitivity to SWC ($\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) showed a marginal, negative relationship with Dim1, so that sensitivity increased with xylem resistance to embolism (Fig. 5.6). Finally, $G_{\text{REF}}$ co-varied positively with $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$, implying that as $G_{\text{REF}}$ increases so do $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ (Fig. 5.6, Fig. D5). The second dimension of the PCA was not included in the final path model, suggesting a lack of coordination between $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ and water use parameters.\par

##Discussion
In this study, we present a novel analysis linking organ-level traits with whole-plant water use strategies at the global scale, made possible by the compilation of the first global sap flow database. We provide evidence of a coordination between water relations traits and water use parameters ($G_{\text{REF}}$, $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ and $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$), while accounting for the effects of climate and tree size. Some water use and trait associations were explained by climate affiliations of species, but most relationships between water use and water relations traits remained after accounting for climate and tree size effects. As any synthesis effort of this magnitude based on diverse data sources, our study presents several limitations. First, sap flow data used to estimate *G* carry some uncertainty issues, although these may be less relevant for assessing environmental responses as we do here than for characterizing absolute values (@Flo2019). Second, SAPFLUXNET may have an incomplete coverage of global forest ecosystems (Fig. 5.1, @poyatos_global_2020). Third, highly non-linear or threshold-based SWC responses may be difficult to capture, especially when having to resort to reanalysis data. Fourth, other ecological processes such as partial canopy-atmosphere coupling or intra-specific variability in traits and/or water use regulation may influence our results.\par

###Climate influence on water use strategies across species
Our results showed no direct effect of mean annual precipitation (MAP) on $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$, but instead indirect MAP effects on water use strategies mediated through hydraulic and allocation traits (Fig. 5.6 and Fig. D6), suggesting that MAP constrains feasible water relations traits (@bourne_species_2017; @liu_hydraulic_2019), which then directly determine water use rate and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$. The direction of these effects is consistent with previous studies showing that $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ increased with aridity in rainforest species (@cunningham_stomatal_2004; but see @grossiord2019) and at continental scales across ecosystems and functional types (@Novick2016), but these studies did not disentangle direct from indirect effects. Although the global controls on $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ were less clear in our analyses, in part due to the influence of aerodynamic coupling (cf. Table 5.3 and D5), climate effects on this variable also appeared to be largely indirect (Fig. 5.6). Therefore, our results underscore the importance of using water relations traits, rather than climate when addressing species whole-tree water use strategies and ecosystem flux sensitivities to VPD.\par

###Water use parameters
Water use parameters differed widely among species (Fig. D2) and defined a gradient of water use sensitivities to drought stress. Within the gradient of parameters, angiosperms and gymnosperms showed distinct whole-plant water use strategies (Fig. 5.2). We found that gymnosperms have generally more ‘conservative’ water use strategies in terms of lower $G_{\text{REF}}$ but not in terms of enhanced sensitivity to VPD or SWC. Similarly, previous studies also showed lower sensitivity to VPD in gymnosperms compared to angiosperms (@johnson_hydraulic_2012; @lin_optimal_2015), which could be associated to higher safety margins (@choat_global_2012; @anderegg_meta-analysis_2016). The ‘conservative’ $G_{\text{REF}}$ strategy of gymnosperms could be explained by group-specific trait syndromes associated to water relations traits (Fig. D8), wood anatomy (@venturas_plant_2017), and lower photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance or leaf N concentrations (@lusk_photosynthetic_2003).\par

$G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ showed a strong positive correlation across species (Fig. D5) similar to the one found by @Oren1999. This implies stronger VPD control on transpiration in species with higher water use under optimal conditions (higher $G_{\text{REF}}$). However, our global cross-species analyses might mask finer variations, as $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ (or $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ / $G_{\text{REF}}$) is expected to be lower across species from dry sites (@Oren1999) or along a decreasing gradient of SWC within species (@domec_does_2012; @zhang_spatiotemporal_2012; but see @Poyatos2007). Nevertheless, this result suggests that $G_{\text{REF}}$ can be a suitable proxy of whole-tree canopy conductance sensitivity to VPD, as it is at the leaf (@Oren1999) or ecosystem (@grossiord_plant_2020) levels.\par

The lack of correlation found between the sensitivity to SWC calculated with and without aerodynamic conductance, indicates that canopy coupling could be important in calculating  $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$  and that in order to predict and model plant water responses to soil water dynamics, we likely have to explicitly consider aerodynamic and boundary layer conductances. In addition, these land-atmosphere interactions might be crucial in diagnosing and modelling the soil moisture controls over other ecosystem processes such as the carbon cycle (@green_large_2019; @kannenberg_ghosts_2020).\par

###Coordination between water use parameters and water relations traits
Our results support the hypothesis of a strong coordination between $G_{\text{REF}}$ and individual hydraulic and allocation traits. $G_{\text{REF}}$ aligns with ‘efficiency’ traits ($K_\text{s}$) in the hydraulic safety-efficiency axis, and is thus negatively related to ‘safety’ traits (particularly $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$). These results are consistent with the overall proposed coordination between plant hydraulics and gas exchange (@meinzer_co-ordination_2002; @sperry_water_2002; @mencuccini_ecological_2003; @maherali_functional_2006; @henry_stomatal_2019) and with the notion that species operate close to their maximum transport capacity sustained by their hydraulic system (@Manzoni2013). Large individual leaf areas were also related to higher $G_{\text{REF}}$, probably due to higher leaf hydraulic conductance mediated by wider conduits (@schreiber_leaf_2016; @ding_optimization_2020). The positive association of elevated $G_{\text{REF}}$ with deeper roots points out the requirement of deep rooting to supply water for keeping high transpiration rates, and is also found in the coordination between $R_{\text{depth}}$, $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$ and $K_\text{s}$ (@mursinna_plant_2018).\par

Coordination between whole-tree water use sensitivity to VPD ($\beta_{\text{VPD}}$) and to SWC ($\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) with organ-level water relations traits had not been assessed before at a global scale. All the studied water relations traits (except $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$) appear to be related to $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$, whereby the species with more ‘efficient’ or less “safe” traits tend to be those which show higher $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$. These results are consistent with previous studies relating stomatal responses and water relation traits (@lu_optimal_2020) and with the stomatal gas exchange optimization theory (see @tyree_woody_1988; @Wang2020). By contrast, after controlling for climate and tree height, conductance sensitivity to SWC ($\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) was only (negatively) related to $L_s$. Notably, $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ was unrelated to $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, in contrast to Maréchaux et al. [-@marechaux_dryseason_2018], that evidenced more negative $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ related to lower reductions in sap flow with decreasing SWC. This absence of relationship, including the weak $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ -- $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ correlation, could be attributed to noise and uncertainty in $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ measures (@meinzer_dynamics_2014) or with $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$ plasticity (@bartlett_determinants_2012; @rosas_adjustments_2019). In addition, the lack of relationship between $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$ and $R_{\text{depth}}$ could be explained by the complexity of rooting depth dependency on soil water infiltration, tree height and climate (@fan_hydrologic_2017).\par

We also explored the coordinated effect of water relations traits on water use parameters and accounted for direct and indirect climate and tree height effects through the PCA and the path model. Based on our results, water use strategies would be, in terms of $G_{\text{REF}}$, consistent with the Reich [-@reich_world-wide_2014] notion of a whole-plant resource use spectrum, ranging from ‘conservative’ to ‘acquisitive’ species. However, in terms of absolute sensitivity to VPD, our results go against this idea, since acquisitive species (with high $G_{\text{REF}}$) are also more sensitive to VPD (more ‘conservative’). Therefore, our study would support a more physiological interpretation of water use strategies that stresses trait coordination. According to this interpretation, plants with ‘safer’ hydraulic systems (high resistance to embolism) are able to function at higher water tensions without requiring a strict water use regulation, implying that they can show a more ‘acquisitive’ regulation of water use so that they can benefit from having a wider range of conditions to operate safely. In other words, high transport capacity in the xylem ($K_\text{s}$) is associated with high canopy conductance ($G_{\text{REF}}$) and a vulnerable (sensitive) xylem is also associated with a stricter regulation of gas exchange. However, a vulnerable xylem reduces safety, and is usually interpreted as part of an ‘acquisitive’ strategy, whereas a strict regulation of water use prevents hydraulic failure and hence corresponds to a ‘conservative’ strategy. This view is also consistent with the positive relationship between $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$ and $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, even if it saturates at relatively low water potentials (cf. @martin-stpaul2017). These results highlight the complications of defining a single, whole-plant resource use spectrum ranging from ‘acquisitive’ to ‘conservative’ species (sensu @reich_world-wide_2014), and points to the need of considering different organs and functional axes when assessing whole-plant functional integration.\par

Regarding tree’s height, it was coordinated directly and indirectly --through water relations traits-- with water use parameters (Table 5.3 and Fig. 5.6), in a way that taller trees displayed more ‘efficient’ water use strategies. Alignment of water relations traits and $H$ was consistent with results found by Liu et al. [-@liu_hydraulic_2019], relating maximum plant size with $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$, $K_\text{s}$ or $Hv$ at the global scale across species and life forms. These complex direct and indirect $H$ relationships might be driven by ecosystem water availability (Fig. 5.6) and low freezing risk (@olson_plant_2018), which allows for increased water use through efficient water transport (e.g. high $K_\text{s}$ or $Hv$), compensating the increase of resistance due to the enlarged water path of taller trees (@barnard_test_2003; @liu_hydraulic_2019; @mencuccini_leaf_2019). Furthermore, $H$ could also affect differential sensitivity to VPD and SWC in tall trees (@giardina_tall_2018), as their canopy would be more exposed to VPD, requiring higher $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$, and would potentially have more developed root systems, which would decrease $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$.\par

###Conclusions
Understanding tree water use strategies at the global scale is crucial to better predict ecosystem water cycles and drought vulnerability of species and ecosystems. Here we demonstrate that there is a global spectrum of water use strategies determined by the coordination of hydraulic and allocation traits, rather than by climate. In particular, species-specific $G_{\text{REF}}$ and $\beta_{\text{VPD}}$ (but not $\beta_{\text{SWC}}$) are closely related to the species-specific water relations traits. We have also shown significant differences between angiosperm and gymnosperm water use strategies, showing greater water use and sensitivity to VPD in angiosperms than gymnosperms, a finding that could be related to distinct water relations traits syndromes (Fig. D8). Our trait-based approach allowed for a simplified global mapping of water use strategies. The use of simple measurable traits (e.g. leaf size) altogether with functional grouping can lead to a better approximation of species reference water conductance and its sensitivity to VPD. Recently developed global maps of traits (@moreno-martinez_methodology_2018; @trugman_trait_2020) would permit the inclusion of such water use strategies in Land Surface and Earth System Models potentially improving ecosystem carbon and water fluxes predictions.\par
