\section*{Abstract}
The high velocity of contemporary climate change is exceeding plant species’ capacity to track the climate, leading to an ecological context in which climatic conditions do not reflect the climatic preferences of the species present in a community. This disequilibrium between climate and community composition could diminish, however, when critical climate thresholds are exceeded, due to widespread reductions in less suitable species. Here, we assessed the effect of an extreme drought episode which led to compositional changes in rich semiarid shrubland communities in the SE Iberian Peninsula. Using a community climate framework, we compared the community climatic disequilibrium before and after the drought episode along a gradient of water availability in three bedrock types. Disequilibrium was computed as the difference between observed climate and community-inferred climate, which was calculated as the mean of species' climatic optimum weighted by species abundance collected in field surveys. We found that extreme drought nested within a decadal trend of increasingly aridity led to a reduction in community climatic disequilibrium, particularly when combined with low water-retention bedrocks. In addition, community climatic disequilibrium also varied before the extreme event across bedrock types, according to soils water-retention capacity. Our study highlights the fact that extreme drought events pushing communities in the same direction as climate change trends may decrease community climatic mismatch, thus acting as environmental filters that reduce the abundance of species with lower drought tolerance limits. Nevertheless, local environmental conditions, such as soils in different types of bedrock, may constraint such direct climatic effects by buffering or enhancing water limitation via water retention capacity. Therefore, the forecasting of community dynamics under climate change would benefit from integrating local and macro-scale environmental drivers on community composition, particularly under the increasingly extreme climatic events expected with climate change.\par

##Introduction
It has been recognized that climatic gradients influence species distribution and affect community composition. Accordingly, changes in climate are expected to modify many species distribution; however, populations and communities do not always respond properly or instantly to climatic modifications (Blonder et al. 2015). As a consequence, community composition may not accurately match the climatic conditions observed at local scale (Davis 1986, Svenning and Sandel 2013, Blonder et al. 2015). This mismatch between the observed climatic conditions and those inferred from the community composition (hereafter community-inferred climate, Lenoir et al. 2013, Blonder et al. 2015) is generally known as climatic disequilibrium or climatic lag (Davis 1986, Svenning and Sandel 2013, Blonder et al. 2015, Bertrand et al. 2016). This lag depends on a species’ capacity to keep up with climate, across a spectrum ranging from equilibrium state, in which all the species have niche optimums close to the climate observed at a given occurrence locality and occur in all such suitable localities, to different disequilibrium states, in which species lack the niches best suited to the observed climate or those species with climatically appropriate niches are, nevertheless, absent from the community (Blonder et al. 2017). Nevertheless, certain amount of species absences could be expected at equilibrium at fine spatial grains under some population dynamics (Holt et al. 2005).\par

Several processes underlie the climatic disequilibrium of vegetation. Some are connected to the establishment of species in the community:  the failure of more climatically appropriate species to immigrate because their low dispersal capacity (Svenning and Skov 2007), a slow rate of establishment and growth (Svenning and Sandel 2013) or absence from the regional pool (Blonder et al. 2015). Other causes are related to the durability of established species:  persistence in the community of largely unsuitable species, mainly due to their longevity (Kuussaari et al. 2009, Jackson and Sax 2010, Bertrand et al. 2016), delayed loss of ecosystem structures modifying microclimates (e.g. arboreal strata)(Davis et al. 2019), existence of remaining appropriate conditions at a microscale (De Frenne et al. 2013), positive interactions between species (Webb 1986, Svenning and Sandel 2013), or adaptation to local conditions (Benito Garzón et al. 2011). Thus, this climatic mismatch constitutes a climatic debt (Bertrand et al. 2016), in which species are expected to eventually disappear from the community, but how or when these losses may happen is still unknown.\par

Community climatic disequilibrium could, however, be reduced due to changes in relative species abundance (Lenoir and Svenning 2015), by abundance increases or immigration of better climatically adapted species, or by abundance decreases or extinction of less climate suitable ones (Blonder et al. 2015). Eventually, rapid reductions  in community climatic disequilibrium  would represent a sudden payment of the community climatic debt, such as after extreme climatic events or as a consequence of long-term accumulated changes in climatic conditions, when these exceed a critical threshold (van Mantgem et al. 2009, Carnicer et al. 2011, Lenoir and Svenning 2015).\par

Extreme climatic events may act as environmental filters by removing less well-adapted species, thereby triggering community re-assembly and abruptly reducing the lag between community-inferred  climate and observed climate (Lenoir and Svenning 2015). Significantly, this reduction is mainly likely to occur as long as extreme climatic events push communities in the same direction as the trends in climate change (Allen and Breshears 1998, Miriti et al. 2007, De Frenne et al. 2013, Grant et al. 2016). In contrast, other aspects such as  microhabitat, mutualistic species interactions and species plasticity could buffer the impact of extreme climatic events, preventing any major  changes in species composition (Ackerly et al. 2010, Lloret and Granzow-de la Cerda 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013, Valladares et al. 2014b, Graae et al. 2018). Particularly in arid environments, some microhabitat characteristics, such as bedrock and soil properties, emerge as key determinants of plant community composition (Maestre and Cortina 2002, Ulrich et al. 2014), reflecting the role of soils as a major regulator of water availability through their water-holding capacity (Cornwell and Ackerly 2009, Piedallu et al. 2013). Thus, soils and bedrocks could buffer or exacerbate the impact of extreme drought events on vegetation, depending on the belowground water uptake that they provide (McDowell et al. 2019).\par

In this study, we aim to quantify and compare the effect of extreme climate episodes on community climatic disequilibrium, using a recent extreme drought event which largely affected shrubland communities in the southeast Iberian Peninsula (AEMET, 2014) as the study case. Using a community climate framework (Blonder et al. 2015), we estimated the community climatic disequilibrium before and after the drought event along a gradient of soil water-holding capacity determined by three different types of bedrock. Climatic disequilibrium was calculated as the difference between community-inferred climate and observed climate, considering inferred climate as the centroid of species climatic optimums weighted by species' relative abundance before and after the drought. This consideration of species abundance is particularly relevant since studies on community climatic disequilibrium usually obviate it (Gotelli et al. 2010, Blonder et al. 2015) and only consider species extinction and colonization. Indeed, local changes in abundance could be considered as intermediate states of ongoing shifting composition (Maggini et al. 2011, Lenoir and Svenning 2015) and they may be detectable anywhere within species range (Bowler and Böhning-Gaese 2017). Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) Extreme drought episodes would act as environmental filters by pushing communities in the same direction as recent trends in climate change, (in this case, increasing aridity (IPCC, 2014), leading to a reduction in the climatic disequilibrium. (2) Furthermore, the interaction between drought and bedrock types with a low capacity for water retention will exacerbate the disequilibrium reduction, while the interaction between drought and those bedrock types with higher water-retention capacities will buffer against climatic disequilibrium reduction. (3) According to its water retention capacity, site bedrock will, by itself, influence variations in climatic disequilibrium, even under non-extreme climatic conditions, reflecting buffer effects also towards non-extreme climate variation.\par


##Material and methods
We integrated local climatic data, species composition and abundance in local communities and species climate niches to build community climate diagrams which served as the basis for estimating both the community-inferred climate and climatic disequilibrium before and after the drought following Blonder et al. (2015).\par

####Study area and field analyses
The study was carried out in three semiarid shrubland areas close to each other in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, each with a different type of bedrock (Figure  5.1): Cuatro Calas (1.63°W, 37.38°N) on sandstone, Moreras Mountain (1.32°W, 37.56° N) on limestone, and Calblanque Natural Park (0.74° W, 37.61° N) on metamorphic bedrock of schist and slate. Moreover, these areas show relatively low human influence as they are all located within protected areas (Natura 2000 network and Natural Park).\par

All the sites fall under the Mediterranean xeric bioclimate (Rivas-Martínez et al. 2017) and they share the same potential vegetation, with a great number of medium-size and small shrubs such as *Anthillys spp.*, *Chamaerops humilis L.*, *Genista spp.*, *Helianthemum spp.*, *Periploca angustifolia Labill.*, *Salsola spp.*, *Sideritis spp*. and *Teucrium spp.*, as well as some abundant long-lived grasses such as Macrochloa tenacissima (L.) Kunth. The average climate (historical reference period 1970-2000) is similar across the three sites, with a mean annual temperature of 18° C and annual rainfall ranging between 245 and 275 mm (Worldclim version 2.0, Fick and Hijmans 2017)  (Figure 5.1), with no significant differences in inter-annual precipitation variability (Appendix D Figure D.1). During the hydrological year 2013-2014 the Iberian southeast suffered the most intense drought on record (since 1941, AEMET 2014), causing extensive die-off and plant mortality in several forests and scrublands (Esteve-Selma et al. 2015). During that year, in Cuatro Calas and the Moreras Mountain (on sandstone and limestone bedrock, respectively), the accumulated rainfall was less than 30% of the average precipitation for the reference period 1970-2000, while in Calblanque (metamorphic bedrock) it amounted to around 65% of the average (Figure 5.1).\par

Soils in Cuatro Calas and the Moreras Mountain are Lithic Leptosols (around 10 cm in depth) (IUSS Working Group WRB 2015), while in Calblanque they are Skeletic Regosol (i.e., around 1m in depth) (IUSS Working Group WRB 2015). In each case, we estimated soil properties using three soil samples per bedrock type, each one consisting of two replicates of the upper 10 cm. In each sample, we measured the moisture content at field capacity (-0.5 MPa) and wilting point (-1.5 MPa) (Richards and Weaver 1943, Richards 1954, Cassel and Nielsen 1986), as well as the organic carbon content (Anne 1945, Duchaufour 1970) and particle size composition (Gee and Bauder 1986) (see Appendix D Figure D.4 and Table D.1). Finally, we estimated the annual water deficit of each plot during the extreme period, as the sum of the deficit months, by considering the monthly precipitation of each plot, extractable water (field capacity – wilting point) and the monthly potential evapotranspiration (Thornthwaite and Mather 1957). The soil in the Moreras Mountain (limestone bedrock) presented the highest water retention capacity per soil volume unit, followed by the Calblanque and Cuatro Calas soils (metamorphic and sandstone bedrock, respectively) (Figure 5.1 and Appendix D Figure D.5); nevertheless, the absolute extractable water was higher in Calblanque than in the other localities, since it had the highest soil depth.\par

####Community data 
During January-March 2016, 30 replicated plots of 5×5m were established within each area (total number of plots: 90), separated from each other by at least 25 m. All plots presented a gentle low slope and a south or southeast orientation. On each plot, we recorded the number of dead and living individuals from each woody species (38 species in total). The dead individuals were identified according to the following two criteria: (1) lack of green leaves and (2) presence of thin branches (to ensure that they had not died long before the drought episode) (Sapes et al. 2017, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018). In addition, we intentionally dismissed small and low-lignified individuals with less than three whorls (indicating stem yearly elongation) in order to avoid individuals established after the drought period. From these records, we calculated the species’ relative abundance before and after the drought. Species’ relative abundance before drought was measured as the sum of surviving and dead individuals per species/total of dead and surviving individuals, so considering that each dead individual was alive before the extreme event). Very small individuals could have died and disintegrated beyond recognition, but we assume that this eventuality would occurred similarly in the different species and affected to a reduced number of individuals. Species’ relative abundance after drought was measured as the sum of surviving individuals from each species/total surviving individuals. We chose this relative species abundances approach in our study since it is widely assumed that the number of individuals is a good proxy for estimating species requirements (Sexton et al. 2009, Thuiller et al. 2014).\par

####Species occurrence data
The geographical distribution data from the 38 sampled species were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database (GBIF 2019, http://www.gbif.org) and the herbarium of the Institut Botànic de Barcelona. The species occurrence records were then scrubbed for taxonomic name (to remove any non-accurate synonyms) and location (to remove taxonomic and geographic inconsistencies). In order to deal with possible sampling bias, we also reduced the occurrence density, for those datasets with more than 100 occurrences, by randomly thinning species’ records to one observation per $Km^2$ – equivalent to the grid resolution of climate dataset. The final datasets ranged from 60 to 7,000 observations per species.\par

####Climate data
We used 12 bioclimatic variables for the reference period 1970-2000 (Worldclim version 2.0, Fick and Hijmans 2017). These correspond to the observed climate, and all were obtained with a 1 $Km^2$ resolution: annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality (standard deviation ×100), maximum temperature of warmest month, minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of warmest quarter, mean temperature of coldest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of wettest month, precipitation of driest month, precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), precipitation of wettest quarter and precipitation of driest quarter. We selected these 12 bioclimatic variables instead of the total 19 biovariables available in the Worldclim database in order to facilitate subsequent interpretation, avoiding highly correlated variables which correspond to those integrating temperature and precipitation information (i.e. maximum temperature of driest quarter).\par

####Community climate framework
To build the community climate diagram, we first  used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to convert the environmental space of the 12 bioclimatic variables for the 1970-2000 period (observed climate) into a two-dimensional surface defined by the first and second principal components (Broennimann et al. 2012). The PCA was built using climate data from all the occurrences sites of all the 38 analysed species (Appendix D Table D.2) and it explained 78.5% of the 12 variables’ variability (see Appendix D Figure D.2). We chose this multivariate climatic approach to integrate all climate variables, weighting equally independent climate gradients and to determine the overall displacement of the community-inferred climate after drought. Furthermore, we explored the associated univariate relations to assist interpretation of results.\par

We next characterized each species climatic niche by translating the geographical species occurrences into the environmental space and using kernel density functions (Broennimann et al. 2012) (ks package version 1.11.3, Duong 2018) that allow determining density values for each cell of the environmental space. We applied Gaussian kernel, selected optimal bandwidth by cross-validation (Duong and Hazelton 2005), and removed values under 0.05 percentile. In addition, we established the species niche centroid as the gravity centre of the niche (i.e. mean of environmental values weighted by species’ density). From that, we estimated the community-inferred climate for each of the 90 study plots, before and after the drought episode as the centre of species realized niches by weighting each species’ climatic niche centroid by its relative observed abundance in the plot.\par

We also translated the observed climate of each of the plots during the average period 1970-2000 (Worldclim version 2.0, Fick and Hijmans 2017) into the same two-dimensional environmental space. Since the climate database has a 1000 m resolution, almost all the plots within the same study area had the same observed climate value. Both the observed climate, the species composition of a community and the community-inferred climate can be seen on a community climate diagram (Figure 5.2). This approach follows that of Blonder et al. (2015) while also accounts for species abundance, which is a relevant factor for describing community composition. Finally, we also estimated a plot's climatic disequilibrium as the Euclidean distance (i.e., difference) in the PCA space between community-inferred climate and observed climate, where values of 0 in climatic disequilibrium should be interpreted as the complete equilibrium of community composition-inferred climate with the observed climate period.\par

####Statistical analyses
Following this approach, we obtained 30 disequilibrium values per bedrock type before drought and 30 disequilibrium values per bedrock type after drought (one climatic disequilibrium estimate per plot and period time). In order to evaluate the effects of the extreme event and bedrock type on climatic disequilibrium, we built a linear mixed model (lmerTest R package, version 3.0-1, Kuznetsova et al. 2017) with climatic disequilibrium as the response variable and period (before and after drought), bedrock type, and their interaction as explanatory ones. Plot was included as a random effect. We then used least-square means (lsmeans R package, version 2.27-62, Lenth 2016) to perform comparisons between bedrock types within period and differences between periods within bedrock types. We used t-test within each bedrock type before the extreme event to elucidate whether climatic disequilibrium values were significantly different than 0 and community inferred climate were not in equilibrium before the extreme drought. Finally, using the abovementioned methods, we also ran univariate analyses of changes in disequilibrium per each climatic variable within each bedrock type, by using similar mixed models with disequilibrium values per each variable separately as a response variable, period as an explanatory variable and plot as a random effect.\par

##Results
Community climatic disequilibrium showed considerable variations between communities before and after drought, and between communities located in different bedrock types. In general, disequilibrium was higher before the drought (Table 5.1, Table 5.2) and considerably reduced after drought, with important differences of magnitude between bedrock types (Table 5.2, Figure 5.3). Sandstone communities showed the highest change, with a significant decrease in community climatic disequilibrium of 11.34% (from 2.47 mean disequilibrium before drought to 2.19 after drought) (Table 5.1). Climatic disequilibrium in the limestone plots also showed a significant decrease, of 3.81% from 2.89 mean disequilibrium before drought to 2.78 after drought (Table 5.1). In contrast, plots located in the area with metamorphic bedrock did not show significant changes in climatic disequilibrium (2.97 mean disequilibrium before and 2.98 mean disequilibrium after the drought).\par

As regards the individual climatic variables, the highest significant reduction in climatic disequilibrium was observed in the precipitation of driest month and the driest quarter in all three bedrocks (Appendix D Figure D.3). While plots in the sandstone bedrock showed significant changes in climatic disequilibrium in almost all the climatic variables, plots in the metamorphic and limestone bedrocks showed significant changes in only a few variables, mostly related to precipitation (Appendix D Figure D.3).\par

We also found that climatic disequilibrium values differed between bedrock types both before and after the drought and always showed distributions with mean values significantly different from 0 (Table 5.1). Particularly, sandstone had significantly lower disequilibrium than the other two bedrock types before and after the drought (Figure 5.3 and Appendix D Table D.3). In addition, these disequilibrium differences between sandstone plots with its metamorphic and limestone counterparts were even higher after the extreme drought (Figure 5.3 and Appendix D Table D.3).\par

##Discussion
####Impact of extreme drought on climatic disequilibrium
We found that those communities living on areas subject to more severe water limitations during the extreme drought year significantly reduced their climatic mismatch with respect to the average contemporary climate (Figure 5.3), endorsing the role of extreme climatic events as drivers of community assembly (Jentsch et al. 2007, Lenoir and Svenning 2015). Hence, our results support that extreme climatic events would act as environmental filters that remove species with niches conferring low performance (here, species associated to relatively moist climate) in favour of those more adapted to the new climatic circumstances (here, associated to relatively dry climate) (Keddy 1992, Diaz et al. 1998, Grant et al. 2016).\par

We note that this effect of extreme events, like the drought in our study case, likely only caused a reduction in community climatic disequilibrium because it acted as a pressure in the same direction as the prevailing climatic trends (in this case, increasingly arid conditions, Guiot and Cramer 2016), instead of producing random or stochastic changes in community composition (Kreyling et al. 2011). Therefore, the drought episode pushed communities to faster track the changing climate (Easterling et al. 2000). Actually, this directional pressure in favour of more arid-adapted species is further supported by the fact that climate variables related with precipitation showed the highest reductions in community disequilibrium in the univariate analyses (Appendix D Figure D.3).\par

This explicit influence of the extreme drought on community composition is also consistent with the prevalence of environmental filtering as the main carver of community structure under harsh environmental conditions (Valladares et al. 2008, de la Riva et al. 2017, Li and Shipley 2018). It is supposed that extreme climatic events lead to fast ecological shifts and dramatic changes in local abundance in comparison with gradual changes in climatic trends (Svenning and Sandel 2013). However, the impact of extreme climatic events on community composition may remain unnoticed in the long term, being confounded with gradual changes, as extreme climatic events occur in pulses as part of larger climate trends (Easterling et al. 2000).\par

####Bedrock and soil modulate vegetation response to climate
Despite the potential impact of extreme events on communities, they do not always imply changes in community climatic mismatch. Community compositional changes could be buffered by the intrinsic characteristics of plant communities, such as species longevity, biotic interactions (facilitation), as well as species’ phenotypic plasticity and adaptation (Benito Garzón et al. 2011, Svenning and Sandel 2013, Blonder et al. 2017). In addition, local-scale environmental factors, such as ecosystem structure, topoclimatic variability and edaphic characteristics likely play an important role (Lenoir et al. 2013, Svenning and Sandel 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013).\par

Since our study system is dominated by species with relatively short lifespans, climatic mismatch cannot be attributed to plant longevity, which is often the main cause of communities' climatic mismatch on the trailing edge (Svenning and Sandel 2013). In contrast, our study highlights the importance of local-scale environmental factors such as bedrock and associated soil properties. Although our study design (with all same bedrock plots blocked within the same site) prevent us to separate the effect of soil and bedrock from other local circumstances, soils could be one of the main reasons explaining differences in climatic disequilibrium, particularly because the analysed plots were particularly homogeneous in terms of topography and vegetation structure. The sandstone area had the lowest climatic mismatch during the reference period, although this was still significantly higher than 0 (Table 5.1), among other possible reasons because its soil structure and low water retention capacity exacerbates arid climatic conditions (Figure 5.3). In contrast, metamorphic bedrock, which has a high water retention capacity and deep soil, showed the highest historical climatic disequilibrium (Figure 5.3). The relevance of soil properties, largely due to bedrock characteristics, on community composition has been widely recognized, (Prentice et al. 1992, Kruckeberg 2002, Fridley et al. 2011); actually, the interaction between climate and soils can contribute to decouple the species-climate relationship (Fridley et al. 2011, Ulrich et al. 2014, Simpson et al. 2016, Pérez-Ramos et al. 2017, Davis et al. 2019).\par

In addition to site differences before drought, our results also revealed differences in the magnitude of disequilibrium change between sites during the extreme event. While differences in disequilibrium change between metamorphic and the other two bedrocks could also be due to the higher precipitation in the metamorphic site during the extreme event (Figure 5.1), differences in disequilibrium changes between limestone and sandstone could not be linked to different water deficits during the drought (limestone and sandstone, Figure 5.4). Although not significant, the quantitative differences between sandstone and limestone plots could be related to soil properties. For example it could be due to lower nutrient content and higher C:N ratio of sandstone plots (Appendix D Table D.2). This low soil nutrient content has often been related to low plant resistance to drought (Ashraf et al. 2011, Lévesque et al. 2016). So, including soil properties in biogeographical analyses would improve our understanding of species distribution, community structure and vegetation's responses to climate change (Bertrand et al. 2012, Piedallu et al. 2013, Lévesque et al. 2016).\par

####Considerations about community climate (disequilibrium) characterization 
There are, however, some methodological limitations to plant community analysis based on species' bioclimatic characterization. Firstly, the climatic niches represented here are equivalent to species realized niches as far as they derive from contemporary observational species occurrences (which implicitly include biotic interactions and anthropogenic impacts) (Kearney 2006), and therefore, they do not necessarily portray species’ physiological optimums (Murphy et al. 2006, Blonder et al. 2015). Currently, this limitation could only be overcome for few species with available experimentally-derived response curves (Araújo et al. 2013). Secondly, since species are considered uniform entities constant over time, this approach neglects local or temporal adaptation, that could endow a population with different environmental requirements from the mean niche requirements of its species (Benito Garzón et al. 2011, Svenning and Sandel 2013). This assumption could be particularly important in our analyses since most of the species were located on the margins of their geographical range, where populations are particularly prone to show deviant local adaptations (Hampe and Petit 2005, Valladares et al. 2014b, Solarik et al. 2018). Finally, special caution should be taken as regards occurrence and climate databases. Since community-inferred climate relies on every single species’ climatic niche, any bias in the estimation of individual species’ niches will be also propagated to community-scale statistics (Blonder et al. 2017). In order to reduce possible bias, we standardized the bandwidth selection for all the species (Blonder et al. 2014) and visually checked every species’ niche to rule out any overfitting. With respect to climate databases, both community-inferred climate and observed climate are frequently computed on the basis of a relatively coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1 $Km^2$) that fails to capture the local climatic conditions (at 10- to 100-m resolution) actually experienced at population level (Fridley 2009, Randin et al. 2009, Ackerly et al. 2010, Lenoir et al. 2013).\par

In addition to these general limitations, we overcame another habitual constraint on bioclimatic-based community analysis, namely equal weighting of species (Gotelli et al. 2010, Blonder et al. 2015), by comparing species abundance data before and after the extreme climatic episode. This allowed us to detect more subtle impacts on species abundance relative to the total loss of a local population, which can be considered as proxies of intermediate states of ongoing range shifts, before changes in the overall range could be detected (Parmesan 2006, Maggini et al. 2011, Lenoir and Svenning 2015).\par

####Implications for plant communities under climate change  
Our results confirm a community trend to be dominated by species living in more arid environments in contexts of increasing drought, in addition to the generally expected tendency towards increases in warm-adapted species to the detriment of species adapted to cooler conditions (Barry et al. 1995, De Frenne et al. 2013).  The predicted increase in the recurrence of heat waves and extreme drought events associated with climate change (IPCC, 2014) will foreseeably favour communities tracking the new climate, particularly if communities’ resistance is overwhelmed by the magnitude or recurrence of extreme events. Moreover, reduced resilience would be especially dangerous in arid environments, as it could trigger desertification processes (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2013).\par

However, large uncertainty is still present in predictions of community responses to climate change, notably since they are frequently based on species distribution approaches, which commonly disregard lags between species ranges and climate (Blonder et al. 2017, Gaüzère et al. 2018), as well as rarely incorporate biotic effects and their interaction with abiotic processes. Actually, changes in the species abundance of plant communities induced by extreme events would also alter the strength and direction of biotic interaction and coexistence dynamics (Thibault and Brown 2008, Grant et al. 2016), which may lead to more stochastic community trajectories (Kreyling et al. 2011, Alexander et al. 2016, Cadotte and Tucker 2017). Disregarding community climatic disequilibrium and coexistence dynamics could lead to misleading conclusions on diversity dynamics under climate change.
Our results highlight the impact of extreme climatic events, such as strong droughts, on community assembly. Our case study illustrates how such events may act as catalyst of species filtering driven by climate change, accelerating species tracking of climate and associated community change. At the same time, community responses to these events are modulated by local environmental conditions such as soil characteristics, particularly as regards water availability. Therefore, the improvement of community predictability under climate change will require better understanding of the interactions between local environmental drivers and species requirements and interactions, particularly when large perturbations affect the dynamics of species coexistence. Our approach is based on the bioclimatic characterization of the community by scaling-up species’ niches using a biogeographic perspective. This approach has proved valuable for assessing the effect of climate change on plant communities in the short and medium term, particularly when extreme episodes occur.
