 Understanding how plants regulates transpiration is a central issue in ecophysiology since its origins. Plant transpiration links physiological responses of vegetation to water supply and demand with hydrological, energy and carbon budgets at the land-atmosphere interface. Depite transpiration represents the main terrestrial water flux, it is still... \par

In this thesis I aim to give a global perspective on the ecohydrological variables driving the regulation of transpiration using sap flow data at the whole-tree level...\par
