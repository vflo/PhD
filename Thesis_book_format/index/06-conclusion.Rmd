Recent changes in global climate are inducing both changes in climatic means and variability (IPCC Working Group 1 2014), and then leading to progressive or sudden changes on population and ecological communities. The growing necessity to assess and predict these changes has led Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to become one of the most pervasive tools in recent ecological studies (Guisan et al. 2013, Araújo et al. 2019). Along this thesis I tried to elucidate whether niche models are able to determine population responses and changes in plant community composition under extreme climatic events driven by climate change. In addition, this thesis searches for a deeper understanding of SDMs limitations, providing alternatives to overcome some of these constraints. It is the case of including temporal climatic variability, using distances in the environmental space as a proxy of habitat suitability or considering local environmental variables others than climate. \par

##Climatic suitability derived from SDMs as a proxy to explain species decay

The correlation between species’ performance or geographical abundances with species niche is and old assumption in ecology and biogeography (Maguire 1973, Brown 1984, Pironon et al. 2016). This premise (whose version in the geographical space is known as central-periphery hypothesis or CPH) implies that species’ abundance and fitness declines from the niche optimum towards the niche limit. It could be expected, therefore, that the relative position of populations within the species niche correlates with population performance. Nevertheless, empirical studies do not robustly support this hypothesis (Csergő et al. 2017, Dallas and Hastings 2018), potentially because the effect of biotic interactions, favorable microhabitats, local adaptation, colonization dynamics, among others. This lack of correlation, however, does not invalidate the capability of climatic niche estimates to explain population performance, particularly when processes highly influenced by climate, such as decay after extreme climatic events, occurs. \par

In chapter 2, I assessed the capacity of climatic suitability indexes derived from different SDMs approaches to explain plant population responses of co-occurring shrubland species to an extreme drought event. Particularly, I found a clear correlation between population climatic suitability during the reference historical period 1950-2000 and populations’ remaining green canopy following an extreme drought. This relationship emerged independently of the SDM algorithm applied and evidenced that populations with lower macroclimatic suitability, and thus located farther from species niche optimum during the reference period, were more vulnerable during extreme events. Notably, variables related to species foliar strategies helped to explain this relationship, in agreement with functional traits theory. These results support the relevance of niche parameters explaining population sensitivity to climate change (Thuiller et al. 2005a, Broennimann et al. 2006) and suggest that the relationship between species niche and population performance emerges more soundly during extreme climatic events, presumably because demographic responses under these conditions are more influenced by climate than by other environmental variables. \par

However, climatic suitability estimated for the extreme climatic period did not correlate well with the observed defoliation responses, likely as a consequence of the extremely low climatic suitability values obtained for all species. These low values prevented from obtaining contrasted differences among species, hindering the correlation between performance and suitability. These extremely low climatic suitability values could emerge due to the exceptional character of that drought episode that displaced all the studied populations far from their species climatic optimum, even for those species that were more adapted to arid environments. Nevertheless, the poor correlations could also emerge as a consequence of some SDM limitations such as the lack of consideration of temporal climatic variability, or the limited ability of models to predict suitability under climatic circumstances highly dissimilar from those used to fit them (Elith et al. 2010).\par

##Alternatives to overcome SDMs limitations when estimating species performance under extreme climatic conditions

As previously mentioned, in spite of their wide use and functionality, SDMs have some underpinning theoretical and methodological limitations to estimate habitat suitability. For instance, regarding to climatic variables used for model calibration, they usually show relatively coarse spatial resolution (commonly 1 $km^2$), thus ignoring local climatic conditions experimented at individual or population level (Suggitt et al. 2011, Lembrechts et al. 2019b) and hindering precise species requirements (Guisan et al. 2019).  In addition, most used climatic datasets include climatic averages of 30 or 50 years (Hijmans et al. 2005, Karger et al. 2017, Fick and Hijmans 2017), independently of species lifespan. But, not considering inter-annual climatic variability could leave behind numerous climatic conditions that still allow for population persistence; therefore, they potentially lead to underestimations of species’ niche size. This lack of consideration of temporal variability would also bring to understate species geographic range and potential habitat suitability, as well as to assume that shifting climatic conditions displace population farther from niche limit or centroid than they really do. \par

In chapter 3, I developed a procedure to include inter-annual climatic variability in niche characterization and assessed its accuracy to explain populations decay during extreme climatic episodes. I also compared increases in niche size resulting from considering inter-annual climatic variability when building species niche among species with different distribution ranges. Specifically, I found that climatic suitability derived from inter-annual variability-based niches better correlated with demographic responses of *Pinus halepensis* populations during an extreme drought event than climatic suitability values obtained from average-based niches, although both showed to be significant. These results evidenced the relevance of considering temporal variability to improve analyses of population performance in fluctuating environments (Niehaus et al. 2012). Particularly, this consideration of climatic variability in niche characterization was especially relevant when estimating performance of population located in the non-overlapping space between inter-annual variability-based and average-based niches - where average-based niche estimations predict no species suitability while inter-annual based niche does -, suggesting that these populations could be wrongfully located out of species niche when using average climate estimations. Underestimating niche size could also lead to underestimate species distribution ranges or species invasive risk. Importantly, this underestimation of species niche space can also overestimate extinction risk under shifting climatic conditions, particularly in case of those species with narrower distribution range. Hopefully, climatic datasets with temporal climatic resolution are increasingly becoming available (Bramer et al. 2018, Lembrechts et al. 2019a), from yearly (CHELSA scruts, Karger et al. 2017) to even weekly and daily scales (Wan 2008, Wan et al. 2015), allowing for better oncoming consideration in niche characterization and distribution modelling.\par

Even if species’ niche is properly represented, some populations could be, however, located out of niche boundaries due to different circumstances, such as population living in sink habitats with negative growth rates (Pulliam 2000), or population transiently displaced outside  of species’ niche during extreme climatic episodes (Pérez Navarro et al. 2018). In such circumstances, climatic suitability would systematically have zero values, therefore not showing capacity to correlate with population demography and fitness (i.e. mortality or extinction rates, as we see for example in chapter 2). Actually, it has been suggested that the use of SDMs-derived suitability instead of other direct measures in the environmental space can contribute to decouple the correlation between niche and species abundance (Martinez-Meyer et al. 2013, Osorio-Olvera et al. 2019). Therefore, in chapter 4, I assessed the predictive capacity of population euclidean distances to species niche in the environmental space to explain demographic responses; since this procedure allows to obtain continuous values regardless whether populations are located inside or outside of species niche. Particularly I compared the capacity of SDM-derived suitability and distances to species niche to explain co-occurring species decay during an extreme drought episode. In addition, I tested differences in the predictive capacity of distances to niche centroid and distances to niche limit. \par

Despite the fact that distances in the environmental space are scarcely used in biogeographical and ecological studies nowadays, due to the availability of more sophisticated approaches (Franklin 2010, Joppa et al. 2013); this thesis originally contribute to show that distances in the environmental space constitute a more accurate tool to explain species responses under climatic conditions that are highly dissimilar from species requirements than suitability indices derived from SDMs. Likely, the exceptional character of the extreme climatic episode (AEMET 2014) combined with the limited ability of SDMs to predict suitability under climatic scenarios highly dissimilar from calibration conditions (Elith et al. 2010) led to obtain near-zero climatic suitability derived from SDMs for almost all species, preventing from obtaining a significant correlation between suitability indices and populations’ decay during drought. In addition, continuous population responses such as losses in green canopy better correlated with population distances to niche centroid, while binary states (dead vs alive) better correlated with population distances to niche limit, supporting the theoretical view of niche space as a gradient of fitness and niche boundaries as environmental thresholds that separate environmental conditions that allows for species survival (Hutchinson 1957, Maguire 1973).\par

##Extreme climate episodes’ impact on community climatic disequilibrium
Although it is widely assumed in biogeography studies that species are in equilibrium with climate (Peterson 2011, Blonder et al. 2017), populations are often located far from species climatic optimums. This mismatch between local climate and the climatic conditions inferred from community species’ climatic optimums constitute the community climatic disequilibrium (Davis 1986, Blonder et al. 2017). This lag could emerge as a consequence of the presence of long-lived individuals poorly suited to climate (Holt 2009, Jackson and Sax 2010), favorable local microclimatic conditions (De Frenne et al. 2013), no immigration of more appropriate species - due to species absence from the regional pool (Blonder et al. 2015) or to dispersal limitations (Svenning and Skov 2007) - , and could be progressively or suddenly reduced by the arrival of climatically more appropriate species or by the diminution of climatically poorly adapted species following extreme climatic events or long-term accumulated climate changes (Carnicer et al. 2011, Lenoir and Svenning 2015). \par

In chapter 5, I analyzed whether an extreme climatic episode could act as an environmental filter reducing the climatic mismatch between observed climate and community inferred climate. For such purpose I used changes in species relative abundance after an extreme drought episode in rich shrubland communities. The results showed that those communities which suffered more severe droughts also reduced more their climatic disequilibrium, through greater reduction in the abundance of species with climatic optimums farther from the observed climate. Thus, the study evidenced that extreme climatic events which press communities in the same direction as prevalent climatic trends - in this case, extreme drought within a general trend of increasing aridity - accelerate communities’ tracking to climate (Svenning and Sandel 2013). Nevertheless, changes in species’ relative abundances could also affect communities’ coexistence dynamics by changing the forces of species interactions (Thibault and Brown 2008, Grant et al. 2016), thus leading to stochastic community trajectories (Kreyling et al. 2011, Cadotte and Tucker 2017). Therefore, further effort to integrate species interactions and climatic niche is required when analyzing communities’ dynamics under shifting climates.\par

##Local variables relevance on species decay. The case of bedrock and soil.

The potential impact of extreme events on population performance and community assembly could also be determined by biotic and abiotic factors, such as species’ interactions (Svenning and Sandel 2013, Dallas and Hastings 2018), species phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations (Benito Garzón et al. 2011), as well as vegetation structure (Svenning and Sandel 2013), topo-climatic variability (Lenoir et al. 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013) and soil characteristics (Lévesque et al. 2016). Particularly, in arid conditions it has been shown that soil, mainly through its water holding capacity, can be key factor for plant populations performance and communities assembly (Maestre and Cortina 2002, Ulrich et al. 2014). Bedrock properties and soils could buffer or exacerbate the impact of extreme drought events depending on the belowground water uptake that they provide (McDowell et al. 2019). I specifically considered some soil and bedrock characteristics in chapters 4 and 5 to test their impact on vegetation responses to drought, both at population and community level. Particularly, I assessed whether soil water retention capacity and soil nutrient content could reduce species decay at population level, or buffer community decreases in community climatic disequilibrium following an extreme drought episode.\par

In this thesis I showed that populations located over bedrocks’ soils with higher total water holding capacity and higher N content were less affected in terms of remaining green canopy (RGC) and mortality, reinforcing the role of soil modulating plant population performance through water uptake and nutrient content (Kramer and Boyer 1995, Porporato et al. 2004, Kreuzwieser and Gessler 2010). As a consequence, species less climatically adapted to current observed climate but living in more favorable soils reduced less their abundance in comparison with less climatically adapted species living in communities growing over soils with lower water holding capacities and lower nutrient content. Thus, community climatic disequilibrium was less reduced during extreme events in communities located in more favorable soils. The impact of soils in community assembly was also demonstrated by the higher values of community climatic disequilibrium previous to drought in soils with higher sand proportion and lower water retention capacity, in concordance with other studies relating bedrock characteristic and community composition (Kruckeberg 2002, Fridley et al. 2011).\par

##Conclusions

- Historical climatic suitability derived from Species Distribution Models (SDMs) showed to be a useful proxy to explain drought-induced population decay, independently of the SDM algorithm applied. In the studied semiarid communities of SE Spain, species with lower historical climatic suitability, i.e., historically located further from species climatic optimum, showed to be more vulnerable to decay.\par

- Populations' climatic suitability during the extreme episode failed to explain species green canopy losses in the studied community. Presumably, the exceptional climatic conditions during the extreme episode lead to extremely low climatic suitability values indistinctly for all species, hindering to obtain contrasted values between species and preventing any possible significant correlation with decay.\par

- Extremely low climatic suitability values could derive, in part, as a consequence of the non-inclusion of temporal climatic variability in species niche characterization. Climatic suitability derived from species niche which accounted for inter-annual climatic variability better explained observed patterns of monospecific (*Pinus halepensis*) forest mortality than climatic suitability derived from climate averaged-based niches.\par

- Populations living in the environmental space located between the niches derived from inter-annual climate and from average climate, are likely wrongfully estimated to be out of the niche space when using average climatic variables, so, not showing correlation between demographic processes associated to decay and niche suitability.\par

- Differences between climatic inter-annual based and average based niches were relatively higher in species with restricted distribution ranges, in comparison with widely distributed species, suggesting that, in the Mediterranean context, spatial variability may compensate for temporal variability. So, when characterizing species niches with climatic averages, these species are expected to exhibit overestimated extinction inferred risk and smaller potential distribution range.\par

- In contrast to SDMs-derived climatic suitability, population distances in the environmental space to species' niche limit and centroid properly explained population performance responses when population climatic conditions exceed niche range boundaries, such as during extreme climatic events.  In particular, those populations further displaced during the extreme climatic episode from species niche limit and centroid showed to be more prone to decay.\par

- Extreme climatic events pushing communities in the same direction as the prevailing climatic trends led community composition to be re-sorted in favor of those species with climatic niche optimum closer to the current climate, as evidenced by the reduction of climatic disequilibrium between Community Inferred Climate and contemporary observed climate during an extreme drought episode nested within a decadal trend of increasing aridity.\par

- Soils in different types of bedrock, mainly via water holding capacity, can modulate population responses under extreme drought climatic events, therefore exacerbating or buffering the effect of extreme drought events on community assembly. Those soils with higher water retention capacity buffered extreme drought impact on less drought adapted species and hindered for considerable reductions in community climatic disequilibrium.\par
