\section*{Abstract}
We aim to identify the relative importance of vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil water content (SWC) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) as drivers of tree transpiration, which will allow to improve mathematical models describing vegetation responses under climate change. We use sap flow time series of 1858 trees in 122 sites from the SAPFLUXNET global database to obtain whole-tree canopy conductance ($G$). The coupling, defined as the percentage of variance ($\text{R}^{2}$) of $G$ explained by the three main hydrometeorological drivers (VPD, SWC and PPFD), was evaluated using linear mixed models. For each hydrometeorological driver we assess differences in coupling among biomes, and use multivariate models to explain $\text{R}^{2}$ by climate, soil and vegetation structure. We found that in most areas transpiration is better explained by VPD than by SWC or PPFD. We also found that sites in dryland biomes are less coupled to all three hydrometeorological drivers than those in other biomes. Climate, soil and vegetation structure were common controls of all three hydrometereological couplings with $G$, with wetter climates, fine textured soils and tall vegetation being associated to tighter coupling. Differences across sites in the hydrometeorological coupling of tree transpiration may affect predictions of ecosystem and vegetation dynamics under future climates, and should be accounted for explicitly in models.\par

##Introduction 
Plants regulate transpiration in response to variation in hydrometeorological conditions. However, despite decades of ecophysiological research measuring responses of leaf, plant or ecosystem evaporative fluxes to atmospheric dryness, soil moisture and radiation (@beerling_gas_2015), the relative importance of these drivers in determining plant controls on transpiration at the global scale is still poorly known. It is important to disentangle the biogeographical patterns of the individual dominant drivers of transpiration control, as such drivers are expected to show spatially heterogeneous dynamics with global change (@zhou_projected_2019). Thus, understanding their separate roles may help improve models to anticipate climate change impacts on vegetation function and on global water and carbon cycles, and to disentangle land-atmosphere feedbacks (@Massmann2019).\par

Conductance to water vapour ($G$) derived from leaf, plant or ecosystem evaporative fluxes has been frequently used to describe the dynamic control of transpiration by plants at different organisational and temporal scales (@jarvis_stomatal_1986). At short timescales, this control is usually attributed to the regulation of stomatal aperture. Under high atmospheric water demand, which is often assessed using atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD), or low soil water content (SWC), plants respond constraining $G$ to avoid dangerous declines in water potentials preventing physiological damage and severe dehydration (@Oren1999). In contrast, $G$ responses to light (i.e. photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) are linked to plant water use efficiency (WUE). Thus, plants would increase $G$ following PPFD in order to optimize photosynthesis in relation to water loss (@sperry_pragmatic_2016). In addition, PPFD effects on $G$ may respond to the need to regulate leaf temperature under high radiation levels (@fauset_differences_2018). These responses have been assessed in multiple, single-site studies (@jarvis_interpretation_1976; @Oren1999; @Wang2020). However, the fact that these studies frequently used different phenomenological models and model-fitting approaches complicates synthesis efforts aimed at building a common understanding on the controls of $G$ at broad spatial scales. In addition, most of these studies focused on overall $G$ sensitivity (e.g. @hoshika_global_2018), not on the importance of the individual drivers (but see for instance @bretfeld_plant_2018), hampering our understanding of which hydrometeorological drivers dominate G regulation globally.\par

Large-scale syntheses of the relative importance of hydrometeorological drivers regulating transpiration have been conducted using ecosystem evapotranspiration data. Novick et al. [-@Novick2016] compared the limiting effect of SWC and VPD across vegetation types and climates, and found that limitation on ecosystem surface conductance to water vapour caused by SWC increased with climatic dryness, but that VPD limitation was higher than SWC across most mesic biomes. Conversely, Zhao et al. [-@zhao_physicsconstrained_2019] identified that, globally, ecosystem evapotranspiration was not primarily limited by hydrometeorological drivers, but by vegetation height, followed by SWC and PPFD. However, some of the assumptions underlying these studies, that assimilate evapotranspiration to transpiration after data filtering, may not always hold (@nelson_ecosystem_2020). Here, we overcome the limitations of ecosystem-scale approaches by taking advantage of the first global database of plant-level transpiration from sap flow measurements (@poyatos_global_2020).\par

In this study, we investigate the hydrometeorological coupling of tree-level canopy conductance by quantifying the explanatory power ($\text{R}^2$) of individual hydrometeorological drivers of $G$ (VPD, SWC, PPFD). We also estimate the total predictive ability of a model including all three drivers. We then examine the biogeographical patterns of this hydrometeorological coupling of $G$, as a function of climate, soil properties and vegetation structure. We hypothesize differences in absolute and relative $G$ coupling to the hydrometeorological drivers across biomes as a result of specific environmental constraints, with tighter coupling with VPD and SWC in drier biomes. We also expect that climate, soil and vegetation structure determine VPD, SWC and PPFD coupling of $G$, with greater coupling in sites with drier conditions and marked climatic seasonality, in fine textured soils associated with higher water tensions, and in tall stands with low leaf areas that are expected to have tighter canopy-atmosphere coupling.\par


##Material and methods
###Sapflow and environmental data
We extracted 1858 time series of tree sap flow from the SAPFLUXNET database (@poyatos_global_2020). These time series met our requirements for data quality (see filtering section below) and corresponded to 130 species on 122 sites without any experimental treatment (Table C1 and C2). Sub-daily sap flow time series were obtained directly in sap flux density units (SFD; [$\text{cm}^3$ $\text{cm}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{h}^{-1}$]) or, when sapwood area was not available, in whole-tree sap flow units (SF; [$\text{cm}^3$ $\text{h}^{-1}$]; 24 out of 122 data-sets). In those latter cases, SF time series were converted to SFD units by dividing SF data by an estimation of tree sapwood area (ASW) using a global allometric relationship as a function of tree basal area and functional type (i.e. angiosperm vs gymnosperm) as predictors ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.78; n = 2262) (Fig. C1). Using the ‘sapfluxnetr’ R package (@granda_sapfluxnetr_2020), sub-daily SFD time series were aggregated to daytime SFD values (i.e., 6am to 6pm solar time). Following Flo et al. [-@Flo2019], sap flow time series measured with non-calibrated heat dissipation sensors were corrected for bias in absolute SFD multiplying by a constant factor (1.405).\par

Similarly to SFD, we obtained VPD [kPa] and PPFD [$\mu$mol $\text{m}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$] time series for each site from SAPFLUXNET on-site measurements, which were subsequently averaged to daytime values. When PPFD data were not available in the datasets (12 out of 122 sites), PPFD was calculated using the mean short-wave radiation between 6am and 6pm extracted from the ERA5 re-analyses data base (Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), [-@copernicus_climate_change_service_c3s_era5_2017]) and then multiplying by 2.3 to transform it into PPFD. Soil water content (SWC; v/v) data were missing in 43% of the SAPFLUXNET datasets included in this study. To ensure homogeneity across sites, we used SWC from the 15-30 cm soil depth layer obtained from the ERA5-land reanalysis dataset (Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), [-@copernicus_climate_change_service_c3s_c3s_2019]) at 9x9km resolution (see database validation in Chapter 5).\par

###Data filtering

In order to minimize seasonal phenological changes in leaf area, we excluded all periods between 15 days before the first daytime average temperature under 0$^{\circ}$C and 30 days after the last day with temperatures under 0$^{\circ}$C, during the cold season of each site (similar to @Novick2016). To prevent artefacts in whole-tree canopy conductance calculation (@ewers_analyses_2000), we filtered out rainy days --days when SWC increased-- and days when average daytime VPD was under 0.3 kPa (@anderegg_hydraulic_2018). We also ensured a sufficient range in hydrometeorological conditions by discarding sites with a total VPD range below 0.5 kPa or SWC range below 0.05 $\text{m}^{3}$ $\text{m}^{-3}$, and with PPFD maximum values below 400 $\mu$mol $\text{m}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$.\par


###Whole-tree canopy conductance calculation

To obtain $G_s$, we firstly transformed SFD units from [$\text{cm}^3$ $\text{cm}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{h}^{-1}$] to [Kg $\text{m}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$] and then we converted it to daytime tree canopy conductance per unit of sapwood area $G_{\text{Asw}}$ [mol $\text{m}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$] following Phillips & Oren [-@phillips_comparison_1998] and a unit transformation (eq.1).

\begin{equation}
G_{Asw,j,i,k} = \frac{115.8 + 0.4236 \: T_{j , i} \cdot SFD_{j , i , k}}{VPD_{j,i}}\cdot \eta \cdot \frac{T_0}{(T_0 + T_{j,i})} \cdot \frac{P_0 \: e^{0.00012 \cdot h_i}}{P_0}
\end{equation}

Where  $SFD_{j,i,k}$ is the sap flux density value of each site ($j$), day ($i$), and tree ($k$); ${T}_{j,i}$ [ºC] is the temperature, $VPD_{j,i}$ [kPa] is the daytime vapour pressure deficit, $\eta$ equals 44.6 mol $\text{m}^{-3}$, $T_0$ is 273 K, $P_0$ is 101,325 Pa and $h$ [m] is the altitude of each site. For two sites where $h$ values were not available, it was extracted from The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM) (Earth Resources Observation And Science (EROS) Center, [-@earth_resources_observation_and_science_eros_center_shuttle_2017]).\par

###Hydrometeorological coupling quantification

We define hydrometeorological coupling as the coefficient of determination ($\text{R}^2$) of simple and multiple linear mixed models of VPD, SWC and PPFD explaining $G_{\text{Asw}}$ at the site-tree level. High $\text{R}^2$ levels imply high predictive power of hydrometeorological drivers over $G_{\text{Asw}}$. To do that, we started by binning the data to avoid issues related to unbalanced distributions of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ throughout the range of VPD, SWC or PPFD. Specifically, we calculated the average of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ measurements comprised in 0.2 kPa VPD intervals, five site-specific SWC intervals and 250 $\mu$mol $\text{m}^{-2}_{\text{Asw}}$ $\text{s}^{-1}$ PPFD intervals. For each summarized $G_{\text{Asw}}$ we defined a specific VPD, SWC and PPFD value as the average values of VPD, SWC and PPFD of the data inside each bin. Then, we fitted uni-variate models for each site using $G_{\text{Asw}}$ as response variable and the neperian logarithm of each driver as predictor (Fig. C4). Similarly, we also fitted an additive, multiple regression models of site-level $G_{\text{Asw}}$ as a function of the logarithm of all three hydrometeorological drivers (TOTAL model). The hierarchical structure of species and trees within sites was taken into account using linear mixed models, implemented with the lmer function of the ‘lme4’ R package (@Bates2015). When sites had more than one tree per species and more than one species (54 out of 122 sites), random intercept and slopes parameters were fitted for species, and random intercept parameters for trees nested into species. When models did not converge, the random structure was simplified and only trees random intercept parameters were fitted (33 out of 54 sites). When sites had just one species and multiple trees (67 out of 122 sites), we fitted a random intercept for trees. When a site had multiple species and just one tree per species (1 out of 122), random intercept and slopes were fitted for species.\par

Since we were interested in total coupling of the individuals of the site, hydrometeorological coupling was set as the conditional $\text{R}^2$ of the models (i.e. $\text{R}^2_{\text{VPD}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{PPFD}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{TOTAL}}$) (Table C3), calculated with the ‘MuMIn’ R package (@barton_mumin_2020). We fitted simple and multiple regression models instead of more sophisticated non-linear models to reduce complexity and gain generalizability across the data sets. An alternative analysis fitting generalized additive models (GAM) as implemented in the bam function of the ‘mgcv’ R package (@wood_fast_2011), and specifying the same random structure, resulted in coupling values highly correlated to those obtained with the simpler linear modelling approach presented here ($\text{r}_{\text{VPD}}$ = 0.88, $\text{r}_{\text{SWC}}$ = 0.89, $\text{r}_{\text{PPFD}}$ = 0.88, $\text{r}_{\text{TOTAL}}$ = 0.74).\par

###Biome classification and site-level bioclimatic data

The estimates of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ hydrometeorological coupling were complemented with site-level data on climate, soil properties and vegetation structure. These data were either directly obtained from the metadata associated to each SAPFLUXNET dataset or from additional data sources. We took from SAPFLUXNET the biome corresponding to each site --obtained from Whittaker diagrams using Chelsa Climate databases (@karger_climatologies_2017) (Fig. C2)-- and carried out an exhaustive quality control to reassign site biomes when necessary (Table C2) in consultation with SAPFLUXNET datasets contributors. Biomes were simplified into 5 groups; drylands (DRY), woodlands (WOOD), temperate forest (TEMP), boreal forests (BOR) and tropical forests (TROP) (Table C4 and Fig. C2).\par

For each site, we extracted climate information from global rasters (Fig. C3). We used monthly mean precipitation, monthly maximum temperature and monthly minimum temperature rasters for the period 1979 to 2013 from the Chelsa Climate databases (@karger_climatologies_2017), to estimate monthly potential evapotranspiration (mPET), annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) using the ‘envirem’ R package (Title & Bemmels, 2018). Then, we calculated MAP over PET (PPET) as a water availability index, and the standard deviation of the monthly differences between mean precipitation and mPET ($\text{P-PET}_{\text{sd}}$) as an index of seasonality in water availability. Relevant soil parameters were obtained from in situ data in SAPFLUXNET and complemented with SoilGrids 2.0 (Hengl et al., 2017) when data were not available in SAPFLUXNET (Table C3). We used the proportion of sand and clay particles in the fine earth fraction [%], the total nitrogen [g $\text{kg}^{-1}$] and the depth to bedrock (up to 200 cm) to characterize soils. We used bedrock depth because of its ecological relevance, but results for this variable should be considered with caution due to its particularly high variability at fine spatial scales. Stand height was available in SAPFLUXNET for most sites. When this was not the case, information was completed using the average tree height of the corresponding site (again from SAPFLUXNET, 3 out of 122 sites) or when both were absent it was extracted from the Global 1km Forest Canopy Height raster (@simard_mapping_2011) (3 out of 122 sites) (Table C3). When site LAI was not available from SAPFLUXNET (37 out of 122 sites), it was estimated as the average of the 95th percentile of the period 2010 to 2016 of the MCD15A3H.006 MODIS Leaf Area Index product (0.5x0.5 km grid) (@Myneni2015), calculated using Google Earth Engine (@gorelick_google_2017) (Table C3). All raster manipulation was performed with ‘raster’ and ‘stars’ R packages (@hijmans_raster_2020; @pebesma_stars_2020) using a common coordinate reference system.\par

###Statistical analyses

In order to test whether the hydrometeorological coupling of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ varies across biomes, we fitted weighted regressions using the modelled $\text{R}^2_{\text{VPD}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{PPFD}}$ and $\text{R}^2_{\text{TOTAL}}$ as response variables and biome as explanatory variable (fixed factor). The number of tree-days with SFD measurements in each site was used as a weighting variable. Similarly, we also tested the significance of cross-biome differences between paired hydrometeorological couplings (e.g. difference between VPD and SWC coupling, $\text{R}^2_{\text{VPD}}$ – $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$) using the same model structure.\par

We further explained the biogeographical patterns in the hydrometeorological coupling across sites as a function of climate, soil properties and vegetation structure. We fitted four multiple weighted regression models with $\text{R}^2_{\text{VPD}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{PPFD}}$ and $\text{R}^2_{\text{TOTAL}}$ as response variables and log(PPET), log($\text{P-PET}_{\text{sd}}$), soil % clay, soil total nitrogen, soil bedrock depth, stand height and LAI as bioclimatic predictors (Fig. C3). We also used the number of tree-days of each site as weighting variable. Sand percentage was not included due to a high correlation with soil % clay (r = -0.73). A stepwise model selection process based on minimising AIC was applied. We checked for normality and homoscedasticity of residuals in all models, and we also checked for multicollinearity by quantifying Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) using the ‘performance’ R package (@ludecke_assessment_2020). These models were combined with the rasters of bioclimatic data (at a uniform resolution of 9x9 km), to predict and map global patterns of $G$ hydrometeorological coupling to VPD, SWC and PPFD.\par

We also assessed the relative importance of each hydrometeorological driver by extracting the marginal partial $\text{R}^2$ of each hydrometeorological variable of the complete (TOTAL) model. These partial $\text{R}^2$ were calculated using ‘r2beta’ function of the R r2glmm package (@jaeger_r2glmm_2017) and relativized by the sum of the three partial $\text{R}^2$ (relative $\text{R}^2$). These relative $\text{R}^2$ values can be interpreted as the relative importance of each hydrometeorological variable in limiting transpiration. Then, similarly as above, we fitted three multiple weighted regression models using the estimated relative $\text{R}^2$ as response variables and the bioclimatic variables as predictors. The resulting models were used to project the relative importance of each hydrometeorological driver globally. All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.6.2 (@r_core_team_r_2018).\par

##Results

We found large differences in the coupling of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ ($\text{R}^2$ coupling metric) to each of the individual hydrometeorological drivers globally and among biomes (Fig. 4.1 and Table 4.1). We observed that $G_{\text{Asw}}$ was predominantly coupled to VPD across biomes (Fig. 4.1), while $G_{\text{Asw}}$ coupling to SWC and PPFD was comparatively less important. Although coupling to SWC and PPFD were relatively similar, the effect of SWC was higher for DRY, TEMP and particularly WOOD biomes whereas PPFD tended to dominate for BOR and TROP biomes (Table 4.1). The outcomes of the linear models show a significantly higher VPD coupling for TEMP and TROP biomes than for DRY (Table. 1). Somewhat surprisingly, SWC coupling was significantly higher for TEMP, TROP and also WOOD biomes than for the DRY biome. The PPFD coupling was also lowest for the DRY biome and was significantly higher for TEMP, BOR and TROP biomes; the $G_{\text{Asw}}$ coupling to PPFD was also significantly lower in the WOOD biome compared to TEMP and TROP biomes (Table 4.1). The DRY biome was the one in which all three drivers collectively explained less variability in $G_{\text{Asw}}$.\par

In the models explaining the biogeographical patterns of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ hydrometeorological coupling (which explained 26-35% of the variance), climate, soil and vegetation structure variables were identified as common controls on the $G_{\text{Asw}}$ hydrometeorological coupling (Table 4.2). In particular, log(PPET), soil clay %, and stand height were selected for all three hydrometeorological drivers (i.e. VPD, SWC and PPFD) and the TOTAL model, with tighter coupling always associated to higher climatic water availability, fine textured soils and taller vegetation. In addition, seasonality in water availability and LAI were associated with lower coupling to VPD and PPFD, whereas soil nitrogen had the exact opposite effect. Bedrock depth was only selected for the $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$ model, in which deeper soils were associated with looser coupling, although the effect was not statistically significant (Table 4.2).\par

When predictions of $G_{\text{Asw}}$ coupling to each of the hydrometeorological drivers were mapped at the global scale, a different spatial pattern was observed for all three drivers (Fig. 4.2). $G_{\text{Asw}}$ coupling to VPD was higher than ca. 50% almost everywhere except for some sub-tropical regions. The regulation of tree water fluxes at high northern latitudes (above 50$^{\circ}$ N) and in tropical regions was highly coupled to VPD, SWC and PPFD (Fig. 4.2). In contrast, trees living in subtropical regions dominated by the DRY and WOOD biomes tended to be poorly coupled to SWC and PPFD, and relatively more coupled to VPD (Fig. 4.2). When considering the relative importance (partial $\text{R}^2$) of each of the three variables in driving transpiration (Fig. 4.3), northern areas, temperate regions, drylands and savannas were typically limited by VPD, whereas tropical regions tended to be co-limited by VPD and PPFD (Fig. 4.3).\par

##Discussion

This study provides the first attempt to examine the absolute and relative importance of VPD, SWC and PPFD as the main hydrometeorological drivers of the regulation of tree transpiration at the global level. All sites presented some degree of transpiration coupling to the hydrometeorological drivers considered, although there was substantial variability in the magnitude of this coupling (i.e. $\text{R}^2_{\text{VPD}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{SWC}}$, $\text{R}^2_{\text{PPFD}}$). We demonstrate that the regulation of transpiration is predominantly coupled to VPD in all biomes, while transpiration limitation caused by SWC and PPFD is generally comparable and lower. Although our sample size is much smaller and possibly biased (see Fig. 4.3 and Table 4.1) relative to global studies based on remote sensing approaches, our results clearly identify atmospheric dryness as the major regulator of transpiration globally, which is consistent with recent reports showing that VPD limits vegetation growth at the global scale (@babst_twentieth_2019; @yuan_increased_2019). Yet, contrary to other studies focusing on the controls of primary productivity (@jung_compensatory_2017; @liu_soil_2020), we do not find a dominant role of SWC on transpiration regulation. However, unlike these studies, our approach focuses at the plant-level and uses actual transpiration data, also considering the effect of light, which has been rarely assessed in this type of studies.\par

Soil moisture coupling of transpiration regulation was only tighter than coupling to radiation in WOOD and TEMP biomes, indicating the importance of soil water limitations on transpiration in these biomes. Interestingly, the importance of SWC decreased in DRY biomes, even if actual sensitivity to SWC was high (Fig. C4). This result contrasts to those found at the ecosystem level, where drier sites present larger SWC limitations than wetter ones (@Novick2016). This opposite result between transpiration and evapotranspiration limitations suggests that the soil contribution to ecosystem surface conductance may be large (@li_simple_2019) and strongly limited by SWC in DRY biomes. The lack of coupling in drylands is intriguing and may be related to the diversity of water use strategies in water limited systems, which range from drought-deciduousness to deep rooting or high hydraulic safety (e.g., @Ackerly2004; @Jacobsen2007). Deep roots, for instance, could allow sufficient water supply to uncouple transpiration from hydrometeorological drivers and specifically from shallow SWC (@barbeta_relative_2017). At the other extreme, exposure to low water potentials results in early stomatal closure (@martin-stpaul2017), effectively disconnecting transpiration from hydrometeorological drivers for long periods of the year. Memory effects (@ogle_quantifying_2015) are also likely to be more common in water-limited systems, which may result in more complex responses of transpiration to individual hydrometeorological drivers. Finally, we did not consider the co-variation between VPD, SWC and PPFD. VPD and SWC co-variation is relatively low at the daily level at large spatial scales (@Novick2016), but in water-limited regions SWC shows strong interactions with VPD (@zhou_landatmosphere_2019) and PPFD (@boese_carbonwater_2018), which could produce compound drought effects that would complicate disentangling the coupling of transpiration to individual drivers. It should also be noted that we focus here on relatively tall woody vegetation, as this is the one likely to be measured with sap flow sensors (@poyatos_global_2020), and hence our analysis excludes extremely arid sites likely to be totally driven by water availability (compare the grey areas in our Fig. 4.3 with Fig. 4.1 in Running et al. [-@Running2004]).\par

Beyond general biome effects, differences in coupling among sites were partially explained by differences in climate, soil and stand structure. Besides the generally lower coupling in areas with less climatic water availability, consistent with the results discussed in the previous paragraph, we have found that regions with high climatic seasonality (i.e. high log($\text{P-PET}_{\text{sd}}$)) are less coupled to VPD (and to a lower extent radiation) than regions with more seasonally stable climate. Low R2VPD under high climatic seasonality may be related to changes in transpiration regulation responses to VPD between the dry and wet seasons (@renninger2010), which could be the case of, for example, seasonal tropical forest biomes with semi-deciduous species (@monasterio_phenological_1976). Alternatively, low VPD coupling could be related to transpiration regulation driven by other bioclimatic variables or their combination, as partially observed in the co-limitation by all three hydrometeorological drivers in many areas where climatic seasonality is large (Fig. 4.3, Fig. C3). Coupling to radiation was higher in wetter sites (i.e. high PPET), which are mainly located in tropical and boreal regions (Fig. C3). This would reflect the key role of radiation as a driver of transpiration in energy-limited areas with shallow clouds and fogs such as the tropics (Fig. 4.2) (@gentine_landatmosphere_2019), and in areas where radiation is a strong limiting factor such as boreal regions (@kasurinen_latent_2014). Our analysis of the relative importance of the three hydrometeorological drivers indicates a dominant role of radiation as a limiting factor in the tropics particularly in South-East Asia(Fig. 4.3), consistent with previous reports (@Running2004).\par

Our results show the key importance of soil characteristics, particularly texture, in explaining variability in transpiration coupling. Trees increase coupling to all three hydrometeorological drivers under high clay content (finer texture), which results in more negative water potentials at a given water content (@hillel_environmental_1998). This result is to be expected considering that we assessed transpiration responses to soil water content, which implies that plants in fine textured soils would effectively experience lower water availability than plants in more coarsely textured soils with the same water content. In addition, our results indicate deeper soils (higher bedrock depth) were associated to lower coupling to soil water availability, consistent with the notion that access to deep water may uncouple transpiration from shallow SWC (@barbeta_relative_2017).\par

Vegetation height and LAI are also important drivers of vegetation transpiration coupling. VPD, SWC and PPFD limitations to $G_{\text{Asw}}$ are typically higher in taller trees, consistent with previous studies (@boese_carbonwater_2018; @zhao_physicsconstrained_2019). Tree height is associated with productive areas with high resource availability, including water. In general, taller trees live in wetter regions and have higher water transport efficiencies and lower resistance to embolism (@liu_hydraulic_2019, Chapter 5). These traits are associated with acquisitive water use strategies and a tighter stomatal control of transpiration (@Klein2014). A similar argument can be used to explain tighter coupling to VPD and radiation in areas with high soil nitrogen concentrations, as the latter have been related to increased transpiration rates in wet soil and greater degree of stomatal control under drought (@shimshi_effect_1970; @Ewers2001). Taller canopies are also more aerodynamically rough and, therefore, show higher VPD coupling due to higher levels of leaf surface VPD. Interestingly, once accounting for the effect of vegetation height LAI had a negative effect on transpiration coupling to VPD and PPFD. We associate this result to the fact that higher LAI is related to lush canopy structures that would have a significant proportion of the leaves decoupled from the atmosphere and from direct radiation income (@zhang_influence_2016).\par

Differences in coupling among sites should also reflect different water use strategies in the corresponding communities. These differences are reflected in part in the climatic, soil, and structural differences we studied, but also underlie the relatively large unexplained variance, which could be related to contrasting water use strategies coexisting in the same biomes and even in the same sites (@anderegg_hydraulic_2018). This implies that species traits should be included if we aim to understand the fine-scale distribution of transpiration responses (Chapter 5) and their coupling to hidrometeorological drivers to predict $G$ responses to environmental variation.\par

In conclusion, we found that VPD is the main hydrometeorological driver of transpiration regulation globally but we also showed that VPD coupling did not increase in warmer sites, as found in ecosystem-level studies (@Novick2016). Nevertheless, the role of VPD in driving transpiration regulation will likely be dominant in a warmer world, given the generalised increases in projected VPD (@ficklin_historic_2017). Using machine learning methods (@zhao_physicsconstrained_2019) and sub-daily data (when SWC is effectively constant) could help to better disentangle the effect of each hydrometeorological driver (@lin_diel_2018), and would allow a more explicit consideration of interactions between drivers (@zhou_projected_2019). Our results indicate clear differences among hydrometeorological couplings and contribute to disentangle their relative effects on transpiration regulation, which determines vegetation water use, tree growth and ecosystem production. Consequently, global models simulating vegetation-atmosphere fluxes should account for the limiting effects produced by VPD, SWC and PPFD and their variability in space and time, which should be facilitated by an explicit description of water transport in plants (@AndereggVenturas2020).\par
