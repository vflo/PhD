\section*{Abstract}
From niche theory it could be assumed that population performance decreases from niche optimum toward the edge of the species niche. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) outputs have been often used to assess the relationship between demographical trends and niche space, but empirical studies has proven weak or inconclusive. Among other limitations that could impede the emergence of this relationship (species interactions, local favorable environmental conditions not included in the models), SDMs could exhibit a limited capacity to predict suitability under highly shifting environmental conditions. Here we propose the use of distances in the environmental space between niche and population environmental conditions to predict species performance under climates exceptionally distant from species optimum. For this purpose, we took advantage of an extreme drought event occurring in the SE of the Iberian Peninsula that highly affected rich semiarid shrubland communities located in three different bedrock sites implying a gradient of water availability. Then, we comparatively analyzed the relationship between (1) population decay (mortality and remaining green canopy) and distances between populations and species niche limit and centroid in the environmental space, and (2) species decay and climatic suitability estimated from SDMs (MaxEnt). We found that distances to the niche centroid and limit better explained population decay than SDMs-derived suitability, highlighting that population located farther from species' niche during the extreme episode showed higher vulnerability to drought. In addition, we found significant differences between bedrock sites suggesting a relevant buffering role of soils on species decay responses to extreme drought events. We conclude that distances between populations in the environmental space are consistent with demographic responses to extreme drought. This approach reveals to be more efficient than the use of climate suitability indices derived from SDMs, particularly when dealing with extreme climate events that correspond to situations outside the species environmental niche.\par

##Introduction 
In his concluding remarks Hutchinson (1957) defined the niche as the n-dymensional hypervolume -an abstract range of multiple ecological conditions- which allow species to persist indefinitely. In spite of the contemporary limitations of niche formalization and representation at that time, Hutchison also suggested that within this hypervolume, all points would not have equal probability for species’ persistence, considering that there would be “an optimal part of the niche with markedly suboptimal conditions near the boundaries”. This expectation could be considered as inspiration  for a largely known paradigms in biogeography: the Centre-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH) (Pironon et al. 2017). This hypothesis predicts that species’ abundance and fitness progressively declines from the geographic distribution center towards the distribution edges, by assuming an exact concordance between environmental and geographic spaces,  given that population performance would decline from the niche optimum towards the limits (Maguire 1973, Brown 1984, Pironon et al. 2016). Nevertheless, the correlation between species niche estimates and population abundance or performance is not consistently supported by literature (Sexton et al. 2009, Pironon et al. 2016, Dallas et al. 2017), particularly when considering growth or recruitment rates. These poor correlations could be due to the influence of density-dependence processes (Thuiller et al. 2014), the non-consideration of some relevant local mircrohabitat conditions (such as soils or biotic interactions) in niche estimation (Csergő et al. 2017, Lembrechts et al. 2019b), or the existence of non-equilibrium dynamics (such as high population growth in recently colonized areas even though these locations are scarcely envrionmentally suitable, Thuiller et al. 2014, Osorio‐Olvera et al. 2019). The existence of these decoupling factors, however, do not invalidate the potential role of niche estimates explaining population performance (Csergő et al. 2017), particularly when this could be strongly influenced by climate, as in the case of plant decay and mortality associated to extreme climatic events (Sapes et al. 2017, Lloret and Kitzberger 2018, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018).\par

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) provides niche statistics estimates which could be interpreted as species probability of occurrence, or environmental suitability, usually ranging between 0 –non suitable environment- to 1 –optimal environmental conditions- (Franklin 2010). They frequently consist on correlative models which relates species occurrences with the environmental conditions of these sites without attending to the functional causality of this relationship, although there also exist other mechanistic modelling approaches which do attend to functional relationships Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Franklin 2010, Guisan et al. 2017). SDMs are reasonably accurate for characterizing current natural distributions of species (Elith and Leathwick 2009, Guisan et al. 2013), although they are also increasingly used to predict changes in species distribution under shifting environmental conditions, as in case of climate change scenarios or potential novel areas for alien species invasion (Thomas et al. 2004, Thuiller et al. 2005b, Broennimann and Guisan 2008, Araújo et al. 2019). However, when projecting SDMs under environmental conditions highly dissimilar from those used to calibrate the models, these models could lead to non-reliable suitability estimates (Dormann 2007, Elith et al. 2010), for instance, by systematically producing 0 value outputs, and therefore hindering the correlation with demographic parameters (Pérez Navarro et al. 2018).\par

According to the niche theoretical frame, species probability of occurrence would be null outside of the niche space, but there are several circumstances that may allow populations to persist outside of fundamental niche boundaries. For instance, they could persist under unfavorable conditions (sink habitats, with a negative population growth) if they are sustained by immigration from source habitats (Pulliam 2000). Plant longevity may also delay climate-induced changes in species distribution (Svenning and Sandel 2013).  Finally, pulses of abrupt climatic changes can temporarily displace populations outside of the species niche (Pérez Navarro et al. 2018). Under these situations of populations living outside the niche space, negative population growth rates (i.e. decay) are, in fact, related to the lack of suitability of environmental conditions.  So, it could be expected to find more negative growth rates in populations located far away from the niche limit compared to populations located outside but closer to the niche. This implies that, in the same way as points within species niche would not show equal capacity for hosting species presence (Hutchinson 1957, Maguire 1973, Brown 1984), points outside of species niche would not have the same potential for hindering species occurrence.\par

Accordingly, niche parameters which allow to estimate niche environmental accuracy even if population are located outside of species niche (when niche suitability estimates can attain zero values) can be useful to explain demographic responses, particularly in sink populations, population suffering extreme climatic events or alien species expansion. Here we propose the use of Euclidean distances between population locations in the environmental niche space and species niche centroid or limits as measures to obtain continuous niche estimates even outside of niche boundaries (Figure 4.1). While niche centroid represents the optimal conditions for species performance, niche limit represent the threshold separating species persistence from extinction, that is, positive from negative growth rates. So, higher distances to niche centroid are expected to result in a more decrease in populations’ fitness and abundance(possibly with a particular decrease after trespassing he niche boundaries), while distances to niche limit will imply positive or negative responses depending on population position within or outside of the niche.\par

In this study, we took advantage of an extreme drought year occurring in the SE of the Iberian Peninsula which largely affected vegetation communities to analyze the relationship between niche estimates and demographic responses in shrubland communities located in three different bedrocks inducing different water deficit. Specifically, we (1) tested whether populations located farther from the species niche during the extreme event show higher population decay, measured as remaining green canopy (RGC) and mortality; (2) compared the predictive capacity of distances to climatic niche centroid and distances to climatic niche limit when explaining populations decay of different species; (3) compared niche-based distances and SDM outputs as predictors of populations decay; (4) compared the relationship between niche estimates and demographic responses on three different bedrock with distinct soil water retention capacity.\par

##Material and methods
####Study area
The study was carried out in three semiarid shrubland areas in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 4.2: Cuatro Calas (1.63°W, 37.38°N), Moreras’ mountain (1.32°W, 37.56° N) and Calblanque Natural Park (0.74° W, 37.61° N), each of them sited in a different dominant lithology: sandstone, limestone and metamorphic, respectively. These areas share similar vegetation communities, dominated by semiarid shrubland species – genus *Genista* spp. (Fabaceae), *Helianthemum* spp. (Cistaceae), *Teucrium* spp. (Lamiaceae) or *Thymus* spp. (Lamiaceae)- mixed with some big-size grasses such as *Macrochloa tenacissima* (L.) (Poaceae). Study sites also show relatively low anthropization symptoms, since they are encompassed within Natura 2000 network or Natural Parks.\par

The study sites are included within the Mediterranean xeric bioclimate (Rivas Martínez et al. 2017), which is  characterized by mean annual temperatures of 17° C, and annual rainfall of 245-280 mm (reference period 1971-2000, AEMET and IP 2011). During the hydrological year 2013-2014 the Iberian southeast suffered its driest year on record, leading to extensive plant communities’ die-off. Particularly, Cuatro Calas and Moreras Mountain accumulated less than 30% of the average precipitation for the reference period 1971-2000 and Calblanque Natural Park less than 70 % (Appendix C Figure C.1, AEMET 2014).\par

Regarding to site soils, Cuatro Calas and the Moreras Mountain are Lithic Leptosols (around 10 cm in depth)(IUSS Working Group WRB 2015), while in Calblanque they are Skeletic Regosol (i.e., around 1m in depth)(IUSS Working Group WRB 2015). In addition, soils in Moreras’ Mountain (limestone bedrock) showed the highest water retention capacity in relation to soil volume, while Cuatro Calas soils (sandstone bedrock) showed the lowest water retention capacity (Figure 4.2). However, it is worth noting that the absolute water retention capacity was higher in Calblanque than in the other localities, due to its considerably higher soil depth. Soil water retention capacity was obtained for each bedrock as the difference between moisture content at the field capacity and wilting point. Both these values were obtained following  Cassel and Nielsen (1986), from three soil samples per bedrock type, where each sample consisted on two replicates of the upper 10cm. In addition, organic carbon content (Anne 1945, Duchaufour 1970) and particle size composition (Gee and Bauder 1986) were also estimated (see Appendix C Figure C.2 and Table C.1).

####Die-off data  
During January-March 2016, 30 replicated plots of 5x5m were established within each area, being separated from each other by at least 25 linear meters. All plots shared similar topographic characteristics with moderate to slight slope and south or southeast orientation. Within each plot we recorded the total number of individual per woody species (total of 38 species) and visually estimated the proportion of remaining green canopy (RGC) per individual (as a proxy of species die-off, Sapes et al. 2017, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018). In order to ensure that the green cover loss resulted from the recent drought, we avoided individuals with signs of older decay (e.g., stumps, decomposed stems, branches with no thin tips). Each individual was also categorized as alive (RGC > 0%) or dead (RGC = 0%).\par


####Niche characterization and distances extraction
We compiled the geographical distribution data of the 38 sampled species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (GBIF 2019, http://www.gbif.org) and the herbarium of the Institut Botànic de Barcelona. Species occurrence records were then filtered in order to remove taxonomic and geographic inconsistencies and to reduce possible sampling bias by randomly thinning species' records to one observation per $Km^2$ (in concordance with the spatial resolution of the climatic dataset) for those datasets with more than 100 occurrences. Species occurrences datasets finally ranged from 60 to 7,000 observations.\par

We used 12 bioclimatic variables for every year of the period 1979-2013 (34 years): annual mean temperature (bio 1), temperature seasonality (standard deviation ×100) (bio 4), maximum temperature of warmest month (bio 5), minimum temperature of coldest month (bio 6), mean temperature of warmest quarter (bio 10), mean temperature of coldest quarter (bio 11), annual precipitation (bio 12), precipitation of wettest month (bio 13), precipitation of driest month (bio 14), precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation) (bio 15), precipitation of wettest quarter (bio 16), and precipitation of driest quarter (bio 17); all of them with 1 $Km^2$ resolution. These variables were obtained after translating monthly temperature and precipitation variables from  Chelsa database (Karger et al. 2017) by applying the biovars function (dismo package Hijmans et al. 2016). The remaining bioclimatic variables were discarded in order to facilitate the interpretation of environmental axis, removing variables that potentially correlate differently for different species or different time periods (i.e. temperature of hottest quarter with precipitation of hottest quarter, since during the average period these variables correlates negatively due to summer drought, while during the extreme year rainfall was higher precisely during summer months).\par

Then, we used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to convert the environmental space of the 12 bioclimatic variables for the 1979-2012 period into a two-dimensional surface defined by the first and second principal components (Broennimann et al. 2012). The PCA was calibrated using every year-climate from all the occurrences sites of all the 38 analysed species (Appendix C Table C.2). These first and second axes explained together the 60.8% of the 12 variables’ variability (see Appendix C Figure C.2). This explicit consideration of between-year climatic variability allows for a more accurate niche characterization, while considering a time scale (yearly) comparable to the extreme event.\par

We characterized species climatic niches by translating species’ geographical  occurrences into the environmental climatic space and applying kernel density functions (Broennimann et al. 2012) (ks package version 1.11.3, Duong 2018), which allow to determine density values for each cell of the species environmental space. Particularly, we applied Gaussian kernel functions and selected optimal bandwidth by cross-validation (Duong and Hazelton 2005). Then, we estimated the species niche centroid as the gravity center of species’ niche (i.e. mean of environmental axis values weighted by species’ density), and species niche limit as the perimeter of species’ niche space after discarding densities below the 0.05 lowest percentile.\par

We then translated the climatic conditions of each studied population (i.e., occurring in plots) during the reference average period 1979-2012 and during the extreme year 2013-2014 into the two-dimension environmental space (population climate, hereafter). Mean climatic conditions of the reference period 1979-2013 period were obtained by averaging yearly climate of each population site for the previously selected variables. Climatic variables of the extreme year 2013–2014 were obtained in 1 $Km^2$ resolution from monthly precipitation and maximum, minimum, and mean temperature records from between 68 and 114 weather stations of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET), by applying Ninyerola et al. (2000) procedure (Pérez Navarro 2018) and the ‘‘biovars’’ function (dismo package; Hijmans et al. 2016). Then, we selected the same 12 bioclimatic variables used for niche characterization. Since the climate databases had 1 $Km^2$ resolution, almost all the plots within the same study area had the same observed climate value.\par

Finally, we estimated Euclidean distances in the environmental space between (1) population climate and species climatic niche centroid, and (2) between population climate and the closest point of the niche limit, for both the reference 1979-2012 period and during the extreme 2013-2014 year. In addition, we also classified species’ population according to whether they were “inside” or “outside” of species niche perimeter.\par

####Species niche modelling
From these described species occurrence and climatic average datasets, we built Species Distribution Models (SDMs) for every sampled species in order to estimate populations’ climatic suitability both during the average 1979-2012 and the extreme drought episode 2013-2014. We specifically used MaxEnt algorithm throughout R (dismo package Hijmans et al. 2011), with 5 biologically relevant and uncorrelated variables from the 12 variables used in niche characterization: bio 4, bio 10, bio 12, bio 15 and bio 17. We also compared PCA axis built with all the 12 variables and with this 5, in order to discard differences between the two approaches (SDMs and niche distances) due to the use of different climatic variables (Appendix C Figure C.2 and C.3). Each species model was built with 20,000 background points in the biogeographic study region (i.e., Mediterranean basin), five-fold cross-validation, regularization multiplier of 3, and threshold feature unselect to produce smoother response curves. Then models accuracy was evaluated using the area under of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) curve (AUC; Hanley and McNeil 1982), where values higher to 0.75 indicates high model performance (Elith et al. 2002). Each species’ model was finally projected over the average reference climate (1979-2012), and also over the extreme climatic conditions (2013-2014), in order to obtain populations’ climatic suitability during the reference and the extreme period.\par

####Statistical analyses
We applied generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) (lmerTest R package, version 3.1.0., Kuznetsova et al. 2017) with species decay (RGC or mortality) as response variable, and population distances to species niche and bedrock type as explanatory variables, with species and plot as crossed random effects. In order to reduce noise in model residuals we aggregated the original database with 12,124 individuals and added the number of individuals as a weighting factor of mix models. Due to the high affectation of species during the extreme drought year, RGC variable showed a zero-inflated distribution, so we decided to separately model RGC > 0 as response variable (with Gaussian error distribution) and mortality percentage (with binomial error distribution) as response variables. We finally built four models for each subset of population distances to niche for both reference (1979-2017) and extreme (2013-2014) period: (1) RGC as a function of niche centroid distance, bedrock type and their interaction (2) RGC as a function of niche limit distance bedrock type and their interaction, (3) mortality as a function of niche centroid distance, bedrock and their interaction; and (4) mortality as a function of limit distance, bedrock type and their interaction (Appendix C Table C.3). In order to know whether population distance to the niche limit was inwards or outwards the niche, we additionally included a niche location variable (“inside” or “outside”) interacting with limit distance. The interactions between bedrock and population distance to centroid or limit were discarded from models in those cases where models showed convergence limitation.\par

Then, we replicated RGC generalized mix models but replacing distance to niche by climatic suitability derived from SDMs as explanatory variable. Therefore, RGC was the response variable and lithology and climatic suitability during the reference period or during the extreme period as explanatory variables. We therefore built two alternative models for climatic suitability: RGC as response variable with lithology and suitability during the average period and their interaction as explanatory variables, and RGC as response variable with lithology and suitability during the extreme episode and their interaction as explanatory variables (Appendix C Table C.3). In both cases we used Gaussian error distribution and plot and species as crossed random effects.\par

##Results

Applying the niche approach in the environmental space we found that the 80.6% of analyzed populations were located within their respective species niche during the reference period 1979-2012, while only the 5.5% of populations were located within species niche during the extreme drought period.

####RGC as response variable

Both distances to niche in the environmental space and climatic suitability estimated for the reference period significantly explained the observed remaining green canopy (RGC) after the extreme events (Figure 4.4 A and Appendix C Figure C.5 A-B, Appendix C Table C.10), supporting that species farther from their climatic niche or with lower climatic suitability during the reference period were more vulnerable during extreme drought episodes in terms of green cover. In the case of niche space estimates, distance to centroid was marginally negatively significant, while distance to the niche limit for the subset of populations located within the niche boundary (i.e., populations located closer to centroid) was significantly related to higher RGC (Appendix C Figure C.5 A-B, and Tables C.5 and C.6). Also, distance to niche limit for populations located outside of the niche boundary was significantly related with more RGC, probably due to the low number of population located outside of the niche during the reference average period, which maybe acted as outliers.\par

When considering the climatic conditions of the extreme episode, RGC was significantly explained by distances in the environmental space (Figure 4.3 A-B, Figure 4.4 B), indicating that those populations located farther from species niche during the extreme period suffered higher canopy losses.  In this case both distance to niche centroid and distance to niche limit –for population located outside of the species’ niche- were negatively significant (Tables 4.1 and 4.2). Contrastingly, climatic suitability during the extreme event did not correlate with RGC presumably due to the extremely low suitability values obtained for almost each population, as a consequence of the high difference between calibration and projection conditions (Appendix C Figure C.6, and Table C.9).

####Mortality as response variable

When analyzing the relationship between mortality and distances in the environmental space during the average reference period, we did not found significant correlation between mortality and population distances to niche centroid (Appendix C Figure C.5 C and Appendix C Table C.7), while distance to species niche limit resulted significant to explain mortality (Appendix C Figure C.5 D and Table C.8). Particularly, in case of population located farther from niche limit towards niche centroid (within the niche), higher distances correlated negatively to population mortality. However, counterintuitively, higher distances to niche limit in populations located outside of species niche, also correlated negatively with population mortality rate. Again, this could be due to the low number of population located outside of the niche during the reference period. \par

In case of population distances during the extreme drought event, we obtained that distance to species niche limit interacting with population position (in or out of the niche) significantly explained species mortality, whereas population distance to niche centroid was only significant when interacting with metamorphic soil bedrock (Figure 4.3 C-D, Table 4.3 and 4.4). Particularly, we found that populations located farther from niche limit and outside of species niche showed higher rates of mortality, while the scarce number of populations located far from species niche limit towards the niche centroid showed lower mortality rates.\par

####Decay and soil bedrock

Finally, site bedrock also showed to be significant. Metamorphic bedrock consistently exhibited the higher RGC and the lower mortality percentage across the different decay models, while limestone and sandstone bedrocks did not always show difference between them in most models (Appendix C Table C.11).\par

##Discussion
####Niche estimates and demographic responses under extreme climatic events

In this study we show that population distances in the environmental space to species' niche limit and centroid both during the extreme event and during the historical reference period explained differences in species remaining green canopy and mortality during an extreme drought episode (Figure 4.3 and Appendix C Figure C.5). In spite of the weak literature support to the correlation between species demographic performance and niche parameters (Sexton et al. 2009, Dallas et al. 2017), several studies have shown better population performance or abundance at the species niche core compared to the species range margins (Jump and Woodward 2003, VanDerWal et al. 2009, Martinez-Meyer et al. 2013, Sangüesa-Barreda et al. 2018), especially under extreme climatic conditions (Sapes et al. 2017, Lloret and Kitzberger 2018, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018). These latter studies evidenced a negative correlation between climatic suitability under historical reference conditions and population decay during extreme drought, pointing that populations historically located farther from species’ climatic optimums showed higher sensitivity to extreme climatic events. Here we show that the use of distances in the environmental space allows to demonstrate that also those populations more displaced from the species niche during the extreme climatic episode are more prone to decay, regardless from the population location within the species niche during the reference period. Actually, population distances to niche limit and centroid during the extreme episode explained a slightly higher percentage of variability in decay models than distances during the reference period, particularly when analyzing mortality (see models $R^2$ , Figure 4.3 and Appendix C Figure C.5). The relationship between population performance and niche distances could emerge more evidently during extreme climatic episodes in relation to normal years because demographic responses under exceptionally extreme climatic episodes are likely more influenced by climate than by other environmental forces, such as unmeasured microhabitat conditions, species interactions or favorable community structure (Dallas et al. 2017). \par

Looking closely at decay models during the extreme event, we observe that the models analyzing remaining green canopy showed lower explained variability than mortality models. These results are consistent with other studies in which green cover losses were seen to be influenced by a wider range of contributors beyond the purely climatic ones in comparison  to mortality responses (Galiano et al. 2010).  Interestingly, distances to niche limit or centroid seemed not to be completely interchangeable when explaining continuous responses (RGC) or binary states (dead-alive). Whereas distances to niche centroid resulted slightly better explicative than distances to niche limit to explain population differences in RGC (Figure 4.3 A-B and Tables 4.1 and 4.2), distances to niche limit according to population position within or outside of the niche boundary, better explained population mortality (Figure 4.3 C-D, Tables 4.3 and 4.4). These findings are consistent with general biogeographic paradigms assuming a gradient of population fitness within the niche, from niche centroid to niche boundaries (Maguire  1973, Pironon et al. 2016), with mortality being particularly relevant outside of species niche boundaries, where environmental conditions do not fulfill species’ requirements (Hutchinson 1957, Maguire 1973). \par


####Distances in the environmental space vs climatic suitability 

Our finding supports the use of niche estimates other than climatic suitability under climatic conditions close to or far away the limits of species tolerance. While population distances to niche limit and centroid during an extreme drought event significantly explain population observed decay responses (both mortality and green cover losses), the near-zero suitability values obtained from SDM (MaxEnt) for the majority of species during the extreme event presumably prevented from obtaining a significant correlation between decay and suitability. These extremely low climatic suitability values probably emerge as a consequence of the exceptionality of the extreme year that actually displaced most populations outside of the species niche, even for those species typically distributed in arid regions. In addition, models exhibit a  limited ability to predict suitability under climatic scenarios highly dissimilar from calibration climatic conditions (Elith et al. 2010). In the case of  MaxEnt, it does not lead to response curves particularly unrealistic outwards training data (since it makes “clamped” predictions, which constantly keep the same prediction of the most extreme environmental value) (Elith and Graham 2009, Elith et al. 2010),  but it implicitly assumes that modelled parameters and variables interactions obtained for calibration dataset will be maintained in shifting environmental scenarios (Phillips and Dudík 2008, Merow et al. 2013), which could potentially lead to extrapolation errors. Conversely, other simpler methods, that do not include variables interaction or complex parametrization, can provide output values beyond niche limits. They can be particularly useful to explain demographic responses under highly dissimilar environmental conditions, such as to predict decay under extreme climatic events, determine negative growth rates for populations located outside of species niche (sink populations) (Pulliam 2000), or assess niche shift risk (Guisan et al. 2014) for invasive species in novel conditions. Particularly euclidean distances in the environmental space used in this study, and Mahalanobis distances have been proposed as good proxies of climatic suitability when aiming to relate population performance and species niche (Martinez-Meyer 2013, Osorio-Olvera 2019). These approaches correct for variables correlation and since they do not include variables interaction, they do not make assumptions about interactions under changing conditions. In addition, they provide continuous values, not constrained between 0 and 1, obtaining values even if environmental conditions do not fulfill species requirements.\par

Nonetheless, it worth noting some considerations concerning both approaches. Niche-related variables and suitability indices do not necessarily depict real species physiological optimums and limits, as far as they do not represent the species fundamental niche. They are derived from geographical species occurrences, which only account for the regions of the fundamental niche which correspond to the current climate, and implicitly include species interactions and dispersal limitations (Colwell and Rangel 2009). In addition, the impossibility of distinguishing between source and sink populations in most occurrence databases (Osorio‐Olvera et al. 2019), as well as the possible bias in sampling makes it difficult to exactly portray species’ realized niche. Here we tried to overcome this last limitation by randomly thinning species records to 1 occurrence per  $Km^2$  and by visually checking every species’ niches and SDMs response curves. In addition, our niche estimations did not account for environmental conditions actually experienced at plant or population level (Lenoir et al. 2013, Lembrechts et al. 2019a), since global environmental databases frequently present a relatively coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1  $Km^2$ ). Finally, both niche distances and SDMs outputs were highly sensitive to the selected climatic variables defining niche dimensions, since different climatic variables subsets are differently related among them - both temporal and spatially (Elith et al. 2010)-  leading to different environmental hyperspaces. We tried to overcome this constraint in niche characterization by avoiding variables that temporally correlate in different way within the study area (i.e. precipitation of hottest quarter negatively correlated with temperature of hottest quarter during the average period, but positively during the extreme drought year since most precipitation were recorded precisely in summer),  and we also discarded highly correlated variables in SDM analyses.\par


####Soils’ relevance on species decay

Even using the most accurate niche estimates, the correlation between population performance and niche position could be total or partially masked by the influence of other factors and processes, such as species interactions (Svenning and Sandel 2013, Dallas and Hastings 2018), local adaptation (Benito Garzón et al. 2011), or microhabitat variables which usually are not included in niche characterization (Lenoir et al. 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013, Csergő et al. 2017). In our case, we included soil bedrock as explanatory variable in the decay models, obtaining that this variable was always significantly relevant explaining both RGC and mortality (Tables 4.1 to 4.4 and Appendix C Tables C.4 to C.9). Although our study design had a block-site structure, where population living in the same bedrock type are also located in the same area, soils are the main candidates among local environmental factors to determine site differences in RGC and mortality since study plots share similar topography, slope, orientation and distance to the coast line. Specifically, we found that populations located over metamorphic bedrock type were significantly less affected during the extreme drought episode (Figure 4.3 and Appendix C Figure C.5, Table C.10) than population located on other two bedrocks types. These differences could be due to metamorphic bedrock soils having the higher total water holding capacity (Appendix C Table C.1). They also showed higher fertility as indicated by its lowest C:N ratio, therefore highest available N. These results are consistent with the generally acknowledged role of soils on species performance, particularly under drought conditions (Shantz 1927, Ashraf et al. 2011, Lévesque et al. 2016, Davis et al. 2019). Thus, these results illustrate the convenience of introducing key environmental variables that likely interacts with climate when analyzing at local level the effects of extreme climatic events on plant populations.\par

####Conclusion

Our study empirically supports the use of niche distances in the environmental space in relation to climatic suitability as a proxy of environmental appropriateness to explain population responses under extreme conditions that do not fulfill species requirements. Our results specifically highlight that species located during extreme drought episode farther from niche centroid and niche limit were more prone to suffer canopy losses and mortality. Similarly, populations historically located farther from the niche core were more vulnerable. Nevertheless, local environmental conditions such as soils characteristics could buffer the impact of this adverse macroclimatic events.\par
