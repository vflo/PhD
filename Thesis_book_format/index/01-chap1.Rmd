##Understanding species distribution in a changing climate
###Climate as driver of species distributions

The current context of anthropogenic climate change has recently fueled the attention given to climate in ecological studies. However, the interest on knowing the effect of climate in species distribution is an old issue. More than two centuries ago, Alexander von Humboldt realized that the vast diversity of plant forms was frequently distributed following specific patterns along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients, from dense forest on lowlands and low latitudes to grasses and lichens on high elevations and latitudes (Morueta-Holme & Svenning, 2018; von Humboldt & Bonpland, 1807 (2009)). Although other authors have previously perceived the possible relationship between climate and vegetation (Lomolino et al. 2004, Jackson 2009), Humboldt was the first on reporting causation by systematically inventorying plant distributions and recording information on environmental parameters. That approach could be considered as a kind of early correlative distribution model and laid the foundations of biogeography science. Since Humboldt essay, climate has been widely recognized as a key factor on plant species distribution (von Humboldt and Bonpland 1807 (2009), Woodward 1987). Nevertheless, other factors such as soils, biotic interactions, perturbations or herbivory have since been recognized as relevant drivers (Morueta-Holme and Svenning 2018, Pausas and Bond 2018). \par

As a consequence of this coupling between vegetation  and climate, it is inferred that plant species could respond  to changes in climate mainly in three different ways: by changing their distribution according to the speed and direction of change in climate, therefore migrating;  by maintaining their distribution but modifying the way they interact with climate, being able to survive under conditions previously unsuitable for their survivorship, therefore adapting; or by disappearing if migration and adaptation rates do not match the climate change climate velocity, therefore becoming extinct. While paleoecological records along the last Quaternary glacial-interglacial periods strongly support species capacity to track the climate (Huntley and Webb 1989, Webb III 1992, Hewitt 2000, Davis and Shaw 2001), past evidences of plant species adaptations to changing environments are less frequent (Davis and Shaw 2001). This suggests that plant species shift their distribution more readily than they evolve to tolerate new environmental conditions, although both processes are not mutually exclusive (Ackerly 2003, Aitken et al. 2008).\par

To properly track the climate at a given temporal scale, plant species are supposed to successfully establish in the new climatically favorable regions (leading edge) and disappear from regions that have become unfavorable (trailing edge) (Svenning and Sandel 2013) with a velocity according with the rate of climate change. Conversely, if climate change rate exceeds species dispersal capacities to arrive to new accurate locations, or species have large persistence time which retard populations extinction in the trailing edge, species will be in disequilibrium with climate (Blonder et al. 2017). Importantly, this capacity to track the climate is species-dependent, since each species responds to climate change with a particular rate and direction. As a consequence, communities composition do not remain constant during shifting climate processes (Ackerly 2003).\par

Current climate is changing with a velocity comparable to that observed during periods of maximum change during the Quaternary (Svenning and Sandel 2013). Human population growth and the increase in per-capita consumption rates after the industrial revolution are disrupting global natural systems at an unprecedented pace. Anthropic greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the ongoing rapid climate change, with global average temperatures that could increase up to 4 degrees above the average for the period 1986-2005 by the end of this century (IPCC Working Group 1 2014). In addition to the increase in global temperature, climate change is also leading to rainfall reductions in subtropical latitudes as well as increases in climate variability, which implies an increment in extreme events such as heat waves and severe droughts (Giorgi and Lionello 2008, IPCC Working Group 1 2014). Plant responses to these changes are already noticeable, from species migrations upward in elevation and poleward in latitude (Lenoir et al. 2008, Devictor et al. 2012), to increasing decay and mortality episodes in lowlands and in the equatorial range edge of species distribution (Allen and Breshears 1998, Jump et al. 2009). The contemporary environmental scenario poses a double threat for species’ persistence, since rapid climate change is combined with the anthropogenic land surface transformation, which have generated artificial barriers that reduce species’ dispersal capacity and increase the genetic isolation of populations.\par

Thus, knowing the factors that govern species distributions is as relevant today as it was in Humboldt's days, since understanding these forces is crucial to face the current environmental challenge, allowing us to predict future species distributions and community composition, to anticipate population, species or ecosystems’ vulnerability, as well as to correctly guide efforts in conservation to avoid severe losses in ecosystem services.\par

###The niche concept
\par

Humboldt progresses on linking organisms and environmental factors and his influence on further researchers probably constituted the germ for the emergence of the niche concept. This concept deeply permeates different fields of biology and environmental sciences, from ecology to evolution.\par

Since its birth, the niche concept has evolved and incorporated advances from others ecological theories, and its meaning has varied depending on time and author. The niche concept emerged in the first third of the 20th century and it is independently attributed to Joseph Grinell (1917) and Charles Elton (1927). Grinnell (1917) was the first explicitly coining the term, and described the niche as the set of environmental conditions that determines species distribution (that is what species require), while Elton (1927), apparently without influences from Grinnell's concept (Colwell and Rangel 2009), defined the niche as the species functional role in the biotic community, mostly referred to trophic level or food webs (that is, how species impact their community). In spite of the different orientation of each author, both definitions shared noticeable similarities, as in both cases the niche was a property of the environment, a place that exist independently of its occupant, that is, without been necessarily occupied by species.\par

Inspired by both two authors and by the principle of competitive exclusion (Volterra 1926, Gause 1934), Hutchinson formalized his niche concept in 1957 (Hutchinson 1957) as the n-dimensional hypervolume defined by the environmental dimensions within which species can survive and reproduce, permitting species to exist indefinitely. He also distinguished between fundamental niche, as the set of environmental conditions that allows species persistence in absence of competition, and realized niche, as the subset of the fundamental niche in which species can persist in the presence of competitors. Although this is probably Hutchison's most famous and cited contribution, his richest and most innovative view about niche did not come until 1978. Whereas his predecessors described the niche as a property of the environment, Hutchinson (1978) attributed the niche to species, which truly constitutes a theoretical advance, since in this way it is forced the separation of the physical space and the environmental space (i.e., an abstract space that describes the set of requirements of a species). From this duality physical space-environmental space (or niche-biotope *sensu* Colwell and Rangel 2009), it is inferred that species’ distribution ranges are just the geographical translation of species’ environmental requirements in the abstract hyperspace, as long as the combination of variables that constitute the species fundamental niche exists in the geographical space and competitors do not impede the species presence. This entails that the realized niche is not only constrained by the effects of species interactions (as stated by Hutchinson), but also implicitly by the lack of contemporary environments corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche (Colwell and Rangel 2009), see Figure 1.1a. This duality and the reciprocal correspondence between physical and environmental spaces constitute the core of species distribution models (SDMs), since they calibrate species niche in the environmental space from georeferenced occurrence data and then re-project back the distribution into the physical geographic space (Colwell and Rangel 2009).\par

The large weight of interspecific competition in Hutchinson's niche concept, possibly as a consequence of the relevance of competitive exclusion in contemporary theories (Pulliam 2000, Araújo and Guisan 2006, Colwell and Rangel 2009), hindered an accurate consideration of the role of species’ dispersal limitations in causing species’ absence in determined portions of the fundamental niche (Araújo and Guisan 2006). Pulliam (2000) integrated the niche concept with metapopulation theory  (Hanski 1999), source-sink theory (Pulliam 1988) and dispersal limitation, emphasizing the relationship between species’ niche and fitness, specifically population growth rate, which allow to identify species fundamental niche with those environmental conditions allowing for a positive intrinsic growth. According to him, species may frequently be present in unsuitable sites where environmental conditions do not permit indefinite persistence in absence of continued immigration (sink habitats). Alternatively, species could be absent from suitable habitats due to local extirpation or species dispersal limitations. These situations points that estimating species suitability from habitat occupancy could be an oversimplification (Franklin 2010). These ideas crystallized in the conceptual model of Soberón (2007) that joins the set of dimensions that affect species distribution in the geographic space: abiotic factors (A), biotic factors (B), and accessible area given species' dispersal capacity (M), see Figure 1.1b. Species may be found in different combinations of these three dimensions, but population growth rate will only be positive at the triple intersection (source habitat). Subsets of the three dimensions where only M and B or M and A intersect will have negative growth rate (sink habitats). In addition, intersection between A and B (potential habitat) corresponds to suitable habitat that is unoccupied due to dispersal limitations.\par

In addition, the niche concept involves some implict and relevant theoretical assumptions. Niche conservatism assumes that species’ trend to maintain niches unchanged along evolutionary periods (Wiens and Graham 2005), implying that functional links between environment and species demography will remain constant in different time periods and space regions. Even though it has been demonstrated that this assumption does not always hold -particularly when species ability to migrate is limited (Ackerly 2003) or during biological invasions (Broennimann and Guisan 2008)- it is implicitly assumed when forecasting future species distributions, since most distribution models extrapolate current links between species and environment. When considering precisely the prevalence of niche conservatism over niche shifts, it its inferred that species commonly respond to changes in climate by changing their distribution. The equilibrium assumption implies that species respond simultaneously to changes in climate, so species observed ranges would properly depict species environmental requirements. However, some species current distribution ranges prove that species are not necessarily in close equilibrium with their environment (Svenning and Sandel 2013). Therefore, inferring species requirements and tolerances assuming that species are in equilibrium with climate at a given time, may lead to niche characterization’ misinterpretations.\par

After the above mentioned evolution in the niche theory, and despite this fell from grace during the late 70s and early 80s -probably due to the crisis of the interspecific competition concept, to which niche concept was closely related (Wiens et al. 2009)-, the niche theory is now suffering a kind of renaissance (Colwell and Rangel 2009), driven precisely by the growing use of species distribution models in the current context of climate change and their application in conservation biology.\par

###Species niche and community assembly
\par
Niche differences enable species to coexist, explaining a substantial proportion of the diversity patterns observed in communities. It is widely acknowledged that variations in biodiversity patterns derives from multiple assembly processes whose relative importance varies between communities (Takahashi and Tanaka 2016, Li et al. 2018). These processes determining community composition include: drift (neutral and stochastic processes, Hubbell 2001), selection (niche processes, including both environmental and biotic filtering, Macarthur and Levins 1967, Keddy 1992), dispersal (a combination of stochastic and trait-dependent processes, Belyea and Lancaster 1999, Vellend 2010) and speciation (Ricklefs 2008, Vellend 2010). In addition, it is generally recognized that these processes are arranged as hierarchical filters that allow or impede the entry of each prospective community member (Pearson et al. 2018). Speciation is the responsible of the global species pool and dispersal filter determine which biological units are able to colonize the local community (Belyea and Lancaster 1999, Weiher et al. 2011, Pearson et al. 2018). Then, niche processes select the species subset with appropriate niches for persisting after environmental and biotic filtering. First, environmental filtering removes those species unsuited to a specified set of environmental conditions (Keddy 1992) and causes overall similarity in the coexisting species niches. Later, biotic filtering (mainly competition) acts promoting niche differenciation, and therefore, reduces niche similarity and overlap (Weiher et al. 2011, Li et al. 2018). Nevertheless, these filters could act simultaneous and interactively (Adler et al. 2013), varying its relative weight across communities and time periods. All these drivers, in addition to demographic stochasticity and neutral dynamics, make community assembly a complex and context-dependent process (Pearson et al. 2018).\par

Despite this complexity, niche based processes (environmental and biotic filters) can still have substantial power to explain community structure, and its relevance could be measured and quantified, taking into account the spatial scale at which each filter is detectable (Weiher et al. 2011). Among other analyses, depicting species niches in the environmental space allows to assess the relative importance of these filtering processes, for example assessing whether total community niche volume is lower than randomly expected combined with lower niches’ dissimilarity than random, in order to test environmental filtering, or whether species niche volume and dissimilarity are higher than randomly expected, in order to test similarity limitations, due, for instance, to competition (Li et al. 2018). Furthermore, it could be particularly useful to assess community changes occurring along with temporal changes in climate. For example, showing whether new climatic conditions are filtering community composition by reducing total niche volume or by reducing distances between community climatic optimum and occurring climate, linked to extinction or decreasing more unsuited species and increases or immigration of species with more accurate traits to the new climate.\par

##Predicting species distribution 
###Species distribution modelling
\par
Species distribution models (SDMs), also known as ecological niche models or predictive habitat distribution models, are widely used in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation plans (Franklin 2010, Guisan et al. 2013). A common characteristic of SDMs is that they are deeply rooted on the niche concept (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). Generally, SDMs could be classify in two main different categories: correlative SDMs and mechanistic or process-based SDMs. Correlative SDMs statistically relate species occurrences or abundances with the environmental conditions of the sites where species occur, to then, project species potential distribution back in the geographic space, not explicitly accounting for the ecological and physiological processes underpinning this relationship. It is widely assumed that these SDMs estimate the species realized niche, since they implicitly include biotic interactions and cannot represent the regions of the fundamental niche that do not correspond to environmental combinations of the biotope (Kearney 2006, Colwell and Rangel 2009). In contrast, mechanistic SDMs use species’ performance responses to environmental gradients (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of species distribution knowing the environmental conditions in the physical space (Kearney and Porter 2009). Since these models allow to characterize the species’ physiological tolerance limits to environmental variables, it is assumed that these mechanistic SDMs approximate the species fundamental niche (Kearney 2006). Nevertheless, due to the high requirements of knowledge of species’ biology and the labor intensity of parametrizing species physiological responses (Holt 2009, Schurr et al. 2012), mechanistic SDMs are not widely used across species, particularly for those poorly studied ones. Since correlative models are the most widespread SDMs in literature and were used in the present thesis analyses, I will only detail correlative model procedures, referred as SDMs hereafter.\par
From the SDMs work flow (Figure 1.2) it is deduced that the reliability of SDMs estimates will depend on the quality of species occurrence data and environmental variables, as well as on the selected algorithm to calibrate the relationship between them. In addition, model accuracy could be assessed by using different evaluation indices.\par

Species occurrence data used in SDMs are frequently included as presence/absence. As other statistical analyses, SDMs assumes that data used for calibration are random representative samples of the studied population. In particular, since SDMs aim to detect the species-habitat associations, the samples of occurrences must be representative from an environmental space view which not necessarily equate to geographical representativeness. Although random stratified and systematic sampling exist for some species (as national forest inventories or “gradsect sampling”, Wessels et al. 1998, Mauri et al. 2017), which provide data on both species’ presence and absence, this is usually not the case for the vast majority of species. Instead of that, most species only account for presence-only records from natural history surveys and museum collections, or from independent research studies, often compiled in global databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org/). In addition, these datasets are frequently biased in the geographical space in favor of spatially accessible areas. This bias could be translated into the environmental space and lead to misleading assessment of the relationship between species occurrence and environmental variables (Araújo and Guisan 2006, Franklin 2010). Anyway, even if representative samples with presence-absence data were reachable for most species, these data would also have some limitations, such us the equilibrium assumption (see previous section), since most species have still not reached their optimal conditions (Svenning and Skov 2004), the impact of management practice, favoring or hindering species presence in determined habitats, or the lack of population fitness information, so leading to not exclude sink populations (which have negative growth rate and are outside of species realized niche) from niche estimations. Indeed, these binary datasets (presence-absence) are worse proxies of species requirements than continuous records such as species abundance (Colwell and Rangel 2009) which allow to discriminate species habitat preferences within suitable areas.\par

Statistical model algorithm relates species observations to the environmental conditions observed in occurrences sites, fitting species response curves to each environmental predictor. The fitted model could be then applied over initial environmental maps projecting contemporary geographic distribution, or over new environmental conditions not used for model calibration (for example, by projecting future distribution under climate change). Fitted model is commonly evaluated by comparing model predictions with a subset of species occurrence not used during model fitting. b) Environmental conditions of each pixel of a region are used to build a principal component analyses (PCA) converting multiple correlated environmental conditions into a small number of uncorrelated variables. Then the environmental space is defined by the selected axis of the PCA (three in this case). Species occurrences could be then translated into this space, where kernel density functions allow to determine smooth density of every cell of the environmental space, determining species realized niche. This niche representation allows to obtain different parameters such as species niche centroid, limit, etc., as well as to convert niche density into environmental suitability, which could be translated again into the geographic space obtaining species geographic distribution maps."}

```

On the other hand, these models include environmental variables recognized to be relevant determining species distribution, such as climate, soil, topography, disturbances, etc.  (Franklin 2010). The values of these variables for occurrence localities are generally extracted from maps rather than from *in situ* measurements, given the volume of data and the geographic extent of most species ranges. In spite of the variety of potentially relevant variables in species distribution, SDMs frequently rely exclusively on climate predictors due to their primacy controlling species ranges but also due to the lack of fine grain resolution of other important environmental variables with high spatial heterogeneity such as soils (Franklin 2010). These climatic datasets are frequently inferred from a limited number of weather stations which become scarcer as they go back in time. In addition,  the resolution of the most frequent global databases does not exceed 1 $km^2$ (Karger et al. 2017, Fick and Hijmans 2017) -although the spatial resolution of regional climatic databases may be considerably high (Ninyerola et al. 2007) -. These considerations imply that the climate experienced by organisms at ground level (microclimate) can substantially differ from dataset-inferred macroclimate, particularly in regions with elevated land cover and terrain variation (De Frenne et al. 2013). Linking species occurrence to climate values other than those really perceived by species could lead to errors characterizing species niche, which will be propagated when projecting species distribution into past, present or future conditions. Lower attention has been paid, however, to temporal resolution of climatic datasets.  Generally, climatic variables are included as monthly and annual averages of reference periods of 30 or 50 years (Hijmans et al. 2005, Karger et al. 2017, Fick and Hijmans 2017), in most cases, irrespective of species lifespan. Using climatic averages instead of the total climatic variability could lead to constraints in niche characterization and underestimations in species distribution ranges.\par

Since the appearance of the first computer-based predictive modelling of species distribution in the mid-1970s (Austin 1971), a vast diversity of modelling algorithms has increasingly become available (Guisan and Thuiller 2005). According to their functioning (and more or less coinciding with their emergence in chronological order), SDM algorithms could be classified as envelope and distance methods (such as BIOCLIM or mahalanobis distance), classical statistical approaches (such as GLM, GAM or MARS) and machine learning (such as random forest or MaxEnt) (Franklin 2010), representing, in addition, a gradient of growing complexity. The former group required presence-only species records, while the two latter groups require presence-absence or presence-pseudoabsence data (when real absences are not available). These variety of algorithms vary in how they deal with categorical variables, allow for predictor interactions, define smoothness of fitted response curves, adopt different statistical assumptions, weight variable contributions, predict species ranges and extrapolate species distribution in novel environments (Elith 2006, Franklin 2010).  Some of the simplest models such as Mahalanobis distance assume that predictors are equally weighted, follow normal distribution and only consider linear relationships between them (Franklin 2010), whereas others more complex models such as MaxEnt can include high-order interaction terms and different degree of  response curve smoothness, although they do not allow to deliberate and exactly control predictor interactions and response curves' complexity, as statistical models do (Phillips and Dudík 2008, Elith and Graham 2009, Elith and Leathwick 2009).  Generally, model outputs are ranged between 0 and 1, and are interpreted as environmental suitability or species’ occurrence probability, though some algorithm outputs require to be transformed to obtain probability values. In addition, regarding the variety of methodological considerations, different algorithms also imply different predictions of species distributions. It has been suggested that simplest models are more suitable for extrapolation, while more complex models are supposed to be more suitable for interpolation (Franklin 2010, but see Elith et al. 2010). Nevertheless, there is still no clear con*sensu*s on which model best determines species distribution (Araújo and New 2007). Instead, model algorithm is selected depending on each particular study characteristics.\par
 
Although error and uncertainty can be evaluated at different steps of the modeling process, in case of SDMs model evaluation is typically synonymous with model performance and validity (Franklin 2010). Commonly, it consists on dividing the occurrence dataset on a training set to calibrate the model, and a test set to evaluate predictions’ accuracy. In addition, differently from other statistical-model evaluations, SDMs accuracy measures are applied to categorical or probabilistic predictions referred to a categorical variable (presence-absence), which requires dedicated evaluation metrics (Guisan et al. 2017). There are different alternative accuracy indexes depending on the relevance of omission or commission errors, the necessity of using probability threshold or the dataset used for evaluation (presence-absence or presence-only). Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) is probably the most frequently used metric, based on the relationship between true and false positives which does not require threshold selection. Furthermore, it allows to compare different models predictive capacity provided that it could be affected by species prevalence (Segurado and Araújo 2004). Other indexes such as sensitivity, specificity, or boyce index could be useful in cases that requires to particularly measure false negative rate, false positive rate or model accuracy using presence-only as test set, respectively.\par

Here details of numerous aspects about SDMs’ data and implementation are not explained, since entering into more details is an overwhelming task that largely exceeds the boundaries of this introduction. I will refer the reader to Franklin 2010 and Guisan et al. 2017 for a complete explanation about species distribution modelling.\par

###Environmental niche characterization
\par
Both species occurrences and environmental variables (with their strengths and their weaknesses, as previously described) could also be used to characterize species niche directly in the environmental space (which constitute the "hutchinsonian duality" *sensu* Colwell and Rangel 2009). Differently from SDMs, niche characterization in the hyperspace allows to obtain niches parameters and estimates other than niche suitability, such as niche breadth or niche optimum.
In this case, the workflow basically consists on estimating species’ occurrence density along the environmental axes of a multivariate space (Figure 1.2). Throughout ordination techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), environmental space of multiple correlated environmental variables could be converted into a small number of uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables. Then, the environmental space will be defined by the selected axes of the ordination analysis (Broennimann et al. 2012), normally in a number of 2 or 3, due to limitations for representation and interpretation of more dimensions (but see Blonder et al. 2014). This environmental space or volume could be divided into a grid of a selected number of cells, each one of them corresponding to a unique vector of *n* dimensions (V~1-*n*) equivalent to number of selected PCA axes, which correspond to the environmental conditions observed at one or more sites in the geographical space. PCA could be either build with the environmental conditions of every pixel of an entire region, or just with the environmental values observed at species’ occurrences sites. Species occurrences could be then translated into this environmental space, from which Kernel density function could be applied to determine the smoothed density of occurrences in each cell of the hyperspace (Broennimann et al. 2012). Finally, quantile thresholds could be applied to remove possible occurrences' outliers.\par

These density values could be then ranged between 0 and 1 in order to obtain habitat suitability values, which could be then translated back to the geographical space. In addition, this and other similar frameworks  (Blonder et al. 2014 n-dymensional hypervolume), allows to estimate other niche parameters not reachable with conventional SDMs, such as species niche centroid estimation (as niche center of mass), species boundaries delineation according to selected density percentile, measurements of distances between population locations and niche limit or centroid, as well as to estimations of niche similarity and overlap when comparing different species or population niches (Broennimann et al. 2012, Blonder et al. 2014). In addition, these niche parameters could be also scaled up at community level, allowing to characterize the global community position in the environmental space and its volume (see Community Inferred Climate and Community Volume in Blonder et al. 2015), and to test niche-based assembly processes (environmental and biotic filtering) as well as changes in community assembly over time.\par

##Thesis aims and scope
###Setting the scene: the impact of extreme events
\par
As previously developed, changes in climate over time will lead to both shifts in species distribution and changes in species niche structure. Actually, under the current climate change scenario, different plants species adaptations, mostly related to warm and dry climate tolerances, are being reported (Franks et al. 2014), as well as an increase in species die-off events worldwide (Allen et al. 2010). Vegetation decay episodes often occur as a consequence of extreme climatic events such as heat waves or extreme droughts, both induced by the increase of climatic variability driven by climate change. Nevertheless, several mechanisms could impede or reduce species decay in these situations, such as: favorable local microclimate, positive species interactions or accurate soil and topographic conditions (Cornwell and Ackerly 2009, Svenning and Sandel 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013).\par

Regions with high historical climatic variability which are also predicted to become more variable in future, such as the Mediterranean basin (IPCC Working Group 1 2014), are specially prone to suffer this kind of decay events. In this context, the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula has recently experienced its driest year on record (AEMET, 2014), causing extensive die-off across different vegetation communities, including *Pinus halepensis* L. forests and areas dominated by shrublands (Esteve-Selma et al. 2015). This climatic and biologically exceptional situation was used as a study system to develop the following objectives.\par

###Objectives
\par
In this thesis I address the question of why some species or populations decay while other persist under extreme climatic events from a species niche perspective, assuming the correspondence between population fitness and species niche (Pulliam 2000, Sexton et al. 2009), and so generally hypothesizing that populations farther from their species climatic tolerance optimum will be more affected. Particularly, I aim to understand the capacity of niche-based indices to predict species and population responses to extreme events, to assess the relevance of inter-annual climatic variability when characterizing species niches, to evaluate the importance of local environmental variables, and to test the environmental filtering role of extreme climatic event by reducing communities climatic mismatch. I address these objectives both at species level (chapters 2, 3 and 4), basing on field decay data of co-occurring shrubland species and *Pinus halepensis* L. forests, and at community level (chapter 5) by scaling up co-occurring shrubland species responses. The specific objectives for each chapter are listed below:\par

***Chapter 2***: To test the correlation between species decay response to an extreme drought event with species climatic suitability derived from different SDMs.
Here I addressed the possible correlation between species climatic suitability and remaining green canopy of shrubland co-occurring species after an extreme drought event. In addition, given the considerable amount of uncertainty existing with respect to SDMs techniques, I estimated the climatic suitability by using four different SDM algorithms, following a gradient of model complexity. Particularly, I examined (i) whether those species with lower climatic suitability showed higher decay responses to extreme events and (ii) whether this relationship was algorithm-dependent.\par

***Chapter 3**: To include climatic variability in niche characterization in order to improve the analysis of drought-induced mortality based on species climatic suitability. In this chapter, I estimated the correlation between mortality of more of 4000 $km^2$ of *Pinus halepensis* L. forests during an extreme event and climatic suitability obtained from niches characterized only with climatic averages and with the complete inter-annual climatic resolution. In addition, I compared the differences between average-based niches and inter-annual variability-based niches for species with different distribution ranges. Specifically, I aimed to test (i) whether inter-annual climatic variability improve niche characterization and the relationship between demographic responses and niche suitability and (ii) whether those species with narrower distribution ranges increased more their niche space when considering inter-annual climatic variability.\par

***Chapter 4***: To use species environmental niche characterization to assess species decay responses to climatic extremes. Here I proposed the use of niches parameters directly measured in the environmental space, such as euclidean distance to the centroid and limits of species niche, which allow to obtain continuous values even when climatic suitability is zero, to assess species decay driven by an extreme climatic event. Then, I compared the predictive capacity of niche-based distances and climatic suitabilities derived from SDM when predicting co-occurring shrubland decay under a drought episode. In addition, I analyzed the effect of local bedrock type, which determines soil water capacity, on the observed decay. Here, I examined (i) whether niche-based distances in the environmental spaces better predict decay responses to extreme events than climatic suitability, and (ii) whether some bedrock types could buffer or exacerbates species die-off under similar extreme climatic conditions.\par

***Chapter 5***: To test the environmental filtering effect of extreme climatic events and bedrock type in Community Climatic Disequilibrium.
Finally, I used species niche characterization in the environmental space and demographic data measured in shrubland communities before and after an extreme drought episode in order to estimate the Community Inferred Climate before and after the event. I also considered the effect of different bedrock types, determining a gradient of soil water capacity. The distance between Community Inferred Climate and the observed climate corresponds to the Community Climatic Disequilibrium. Then, I compared the climatic disequilibrium of these shrubland communities before and after drought and between bedrock types, allowing to test (i) whether extreme drought events reduce the climatic disequilibrium of communities living in arid environments, acting as an environmental filter, and (ii) whether bedrock types with low water retention capacities exacerbated this filtering effect.
