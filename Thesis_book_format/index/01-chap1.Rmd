##Transpiration and earth system functioning
Transpiration is a dynamic process in which water from plants evaporates and diffuses into the atmosphere. Transpiration occurs as a result of the need to incorporate carbon dioxide for assimilation in photosynthesis. This is because carbon dioxide molecule is larger than the water molecule, and when it enters the plant tissues, water escapes through the same pathway. Given that plants require proper hydration to maintain physiological processes, water loss by transpiration is a penalty for the plant (ref). Yet, transpiration can also be positive for plants because water phase transition produced in transpiration cools down the leaves, which reduce respiration rates thus increasing net carbon gain from photosynthesis, and also protect the leaves photosynthetic machinery from heat damage. Thus, carbon uptake and transpiration water loss are inexorably linked and have to be dynamically controlled to avoid desiccation and maintain plant function. This control occurs through stomata in the leaves, that are epidermal small valves with a pore aperture that is usually regulated by plant water status and hydraulic characteristics (Buckley 2005, Buckley 2019). Stomata closes to protect plants from water loss when atmospheric humidity or water availability drops, but this closure increases physiological stress due to reduced carbon gain (ref). Transpiration, which is therefore determined in just a few micrometres, has crucial implications for biological processes at the plant-level such as growth, competition and survival, scale up to the population and species level and even influences the water, carbon and energy cycles, from the local to the global level (Bonan et al. 2003), which are essential cycles for the maintenance of life on Earth. Therefore, due to the relevance of transpiration patterns on climate and earth system function it is crucial to correctly understand stomatal regulation and vegetation water use to accurately model all these processes.\par

Within the global hydrological cycle, vegetation transpiration recycle about 45,000 $km^3 \; yr^{-1}$ of soil water to the atmosphere (Schlesinger and Jasenchko 2014), which represents around a 40% of global terrestrial precipitation (Oki and Kanae, 2006). Vegetation is thus the major user of the precipitation and directly affects the recharge of water systems. Transpiration actively control roughly a 61% of total terrestrial surface evapotranspiration (which is the sum of transpiration and the abiotic evaporation of surfaces). However, this proportion is highly variable within and among different regions (Schlesinger and Jasechko 2014), which could be explained by the different water use strategies of the vegetation within and across ecoregions. Total land surface evapotranspiration and its partition between transpiration and abiotic evaporation drives other biosphere complex processes, such as vegetation dynamics or energy balance, that in turn produce feedback on evapotranspiration. For instance, transpiration dynamics affects temperature regional cycles through changes in latent heat, and drive energy flux partitioning at expense of the sensible heat flux. It promotes clouding formation (Aemisegger et al. 2014) which alters regional albedo and precipitation regimes and, consequently, also modifies energy balance at the surface and in the lower layers of the atmosphere. At the same time, climate affects vegetation physiology and how it regulates transpiration. Different tree species have a specific control of their stomata in response to environmental changes, which means that the distribution of these species and their physiological traits will have consequences for ecosystems and their functioning, and ultimately for global cycles. Environments with high regional water availability and resources, supports highly diverse and productive vegetation, whereas unfavourable environments support slow-growing vegetation and restrict species richness. Fast-growing plants have higher transpiration rates, and therefore increase the fluxes of the hydrological cycle. There is a large global heterogeneity both in space and time in water availability distribution, which drives heterogeneity in vegetation distribution and feedback on the heterogeneity in global transpiration patterns.\par

In addition to water and energy cycle, transpiration is intimately linked to the carbon cycle through stomata gas exchange. The carbon assimilated by plants in photosynthesis depend mainly on the internal leaves [$CO_2$], which enters by diffusion and is controlled by the stomatal conductance (ref). At the plant level, carbon is used to grow and to produce secondary metabolites, but partly is lost in respiratory processes (ref). Limitation of transpiration due to drought conditions, could lead to reductions in stomatal conductance to avoid water loss and, therefore, lead to reductions in carbon fixed by vegetation (ref). Over long time scales, ecosystem under water stress conditions, constrain its transpiration and so it does photosynthesis, producing a decrease in net primary productivity which could be lower than ecosystem respiration leading to an increase of ecosystem $CO_2$ emissions to the atmosphere (ref). Transpiration is also affected by atmospheric [$CO_2$], because as atmospheric [$CO_2$] increases, the ratio between carbon intake and water loss increases so that plants can maintain similar photosynthetic rates using less water, leading to more efficient water use (ref). However, current [$CO_2$] are approaching saturation levels of the Rubisco enzyme, at least for the C3 plants, which implies that future increases in its atmospheric concentration will have progressively less impact on water use efficiency, and therefore on $CO_2$ transpiration constrain (ref).\par
 
Stomata conductance ($g_s$) is therefore a central component of models characterizing Earth system processes since it is the main regulator of water, energy, carbon and nutrient fluxes between terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere (Knauer et al. 2015). Thus, $g_s$ is used in many models at multiple spatial and temporal scales, for example in Land surface models (LSM). LSM are used to provide, evapotranspiration, latent heat and sensible heat fluxes for global climate models (Wang and Dickinson 2012), and also used to represent current potential vegetation distribution and changes to future climates (Smith et al. 1992). Most LSM are parametrized to separately estimate transpiration -calculated using diverse formulations of stomatal or canopy conductance ($G$) (Knauer et al. 2015)-, soil evaporation and evaporation of water intercepted by canopy or litter layer. However, under some circumstances, for example, in ecosystems with seasonal low water availability, this models has been found to perform comparatively poorly (Jung et al. 2007). These low performance have been primarily associated with $g_s$ calculation. There are several formulations for modelling $g_s$, from those which are process-based (ref) to those which use optimal stomatal behaviour theory (ref), however most of them only set parameters across functional types and climates (Manzoni et al. 2011), or uses simplified plant hydraulic properties such as maximum transpiration rate (which information is normally scarce at the species level) (Manzoni et al. 2013). Therefore, the lack of precise parameters describing species hydraulic traits could influence regional transpiration estimations that affect models sensitivity to environmental factors (Wang and Dickinson 2011). This, could lead to wrong hydro-climatological or ecosystem productivity estimates, a lack of responsiveness to the influence of land cover change or simply to erroneous estimates of evapotranspiration variation with climate. This places $g_s$ parametrization in a central position to improve the predictions of these models.\par

##Transpiration across scales
###Water transport in plants
The path for water transport in plants occurs in a continuous film of water through three compartments: the soil, the plant and the atmosphere; and the interfaces that connects them. Water moves along a passive gradient of water potential ($\Psi$; normally negative in plant tissues) between this compartments, from high $\Psi$ (i.e. less negative) to lower $\Psi$ (i.e. more negative), or similarly, on a gradient of water vapour concentration ($\Delta$w, the difference in water mole fraction in air, which could also be expressed as water potential). Water potential -measured as water pressure in Pascals (Pa)- is the energy of water per unit area compared to pure water and, along the soil-plant-atmosphere system, is the sum of hydrostatic potential, osmotic potential and gravity, although this last acts oppose to water flow (Franks 2004) and is only important for tall trees. Hydrostatic potential is the physical pressure that the system exerts to the water and can be positive or negative depending on the system component. For example, positive hydrostatic potential could be observed in the pressure that cell wall produce towards inside turgid living cells, whereas negative potentials arise by capillarity or under suction tension. Osmotic potential component of water potential is related to a difference in solute concentration across a semi permeable membrane, where the solution with more solutes have lower $\Psi$. The water in soil and plants moves under high tensions following the framework of the cohesion-tension theory (Tyree 1997). Water flow ($J$ [$cm^3$ $s^{-1}$]) between any two points of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum is given by its difference in $\Psi$ ($\Delta\Psi$) and the resistance -or typically the hydraulic conductance ($K_H$ [$cm^{3}$ $s^{-1}$ $MPa^{-1}$]), which is the inverse of the resistance- that the system exerts to the flow between this two points, following $J = K$$\cdot$ $\Delta\Psi$ expression of Darcy’s law (Scheidegger 1974).\par

Transport of water in unsaturated soil follow mass conservation and Darcy’s law. Water enters the roots mainly due to a gradient in hydrostatic pressure maintained by the transpiration stream, and to a lesser extend by osmotic potential (ref). As soils dry out, the $\Psi$ of soils decreases because the matrix potential, i.e. the negative hydrostatic potential produced by the force by which water molecules are hold on surfaces, becomes more negative as the water layer covering soil particles becomes thinner. This decrease in soil $\Psi$ produces a parallel decrease in plant $\Psi$ in order to maintain water movement from soil to plant. Water in roots reaches xylem vessels, which by hydrostatic pressure transport the water downstream to the leafs. Water transport in tissues is therefore controlled by the combination of water potentials and plant-specific hydraulic conductivity (k). Xylem k is on turn dependent on water potential k($\Psi$), since it decreases non-linearly due to cavitation formation, and its sigmoidal shape is characteristic of each species due to specific anatomical traits of the xylem (ref). Once in the leaves, water of mesophyll, epidermis and guard cells evaporates into the stomatal cavity. The difference in $\Psi$ between the nearly water saturated stomatal cavity and the atmosphere represents the steeper potential gradient in all the soil-plant-atmophere continuous. Is in the plant-atmosphere interface, therefore, where the control of the gradient is critical to avoid fatal extreme tensions in the plant tissues. Stomatal control an its link with plant hydraulic system -but also anatomy, size, density and location of stomata- are determinant of plant water status (ref). The mechanic control of stomata to environmental drivers are still not fully understood, although it appears quite evident that there are feedback processes (and probably feedforward processes) between stomatal conductance and leaf water status (Franks 2004), and that could be also related to long-distance control from root segregation of hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) (ref). Leaf-atmosphere conductance also depends on leaf boundary layer conductance, which depends on atmospheric turbulent flux produced by horizontal transport inside the canopy. However, under some atmospheric conditions and in tall trees, boundary layer conductance is negligible since it is much higher than stomatal conductance, the canopy is coupled to the atmosphere, and hence the process of transpiration is mainly controlled by the stomata. The sum of all the plant stomatal conductances and the boundary layer conductance can be considered as the whole-plant canopy conductance (Raupach and Finnigan 1988).\par

###Upscaling to the stand and ecosystem levels
The quantification of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum from a micro-scale perspective (i.e. from organ-level) is a complex challenge due to the heterogeneity of the transporting medium and the different temporal scales of the water flux drivers (Katul et al 2007). Therefore, much studies of plants water transport have been undertaken at the plant level, observing simplified macroscopic responses of transpiration to environmental changes. However, there is further challenge when trying to upscale both in space and time, at levels where individuals acclimate and grow, where species composition changes and where there is complex interactions such as competition for resources. In addition, there are micro-environmental and physiological gradients within the canopy that require treating the entire plant canopy simplified as one unit or "big leaf". When transpiration is scaled to stand level, species composition and vegetation size distribution should be considered, to integrate a distribution of parameters describing water transport of the stand. To scale up to ecosystem level, we should make simplifications to allow a proper estimation of those parameters distribution, either by a representation of the vegetation by functional types, or a description by hydraulic or functional traits. Both vegetation classes and traits are suitable for scaling up, but the latter is a more flexible approach since they are continuous variables, which overcome the rigidness of vegetation classes (i.e. functional type or species), and also allows to include intra-species environmental gradients and variability.\par

##Transpiration quantification
There are several methods to observe and estimate transpiration (Shuttleworth 2008) that differ in the measurements temporal scale -from sub-daily to decades- and the spatial scale -from the leaf to the regional level-. At the ecosystem level, continuous sub-daily estimations of transpiration are usually performed using Bowen ration energy balance (Bowen 1926) and Eddy covariance method (Brutsaert 1982), which are based on the measure of turbulence fluxes of latent heat and moisture (see Wang and Dickinson 2012, Kool et al. 2014, Stoy et al. 2019, for further details). This methods have been standardized, and currently there is a global network of measuring stations called FLUXNET which include more than 900 sites worldwide (Pastorello et al. 2020). The FLUXNET network initiative provides a valuable tool to study global land hydrological fluxes. However, Bowen ration and Eddy covariance methods do not allow to easily and directly separate transpiration from evaporation fluxes, thus requiring partitioning isotopic methods (Kool et al. 2014) or complex algorithms to estimate transpiration (Nelson et al. 2020). Since some seminal works such as Sellers (1985), several attempts have been made to estimate regional transpiration and evapotranspiration patterns using remote sensing (Miralles et al. 2011). Although it is one of the best methods for making estimates on a large scale, the estimations of transpiration are based again on indirect deductions of the energy balance on the surface.\par

The impossibility to obtain direct and actual measurements of such large-scale methods, forced us to work from the organ to the tree level to obtain better estimates of transpiration and its dynamics and to separate it from evaporation processes. Since the 1970s, several methods have been developed to independently measure plant level transpiration, however most of them are impractical in the field, either because of their low temporal resolution or because of their limited use on a broad scale due to their elevated cost. Yet one method that can be measured continuously, unsupervised, for extended periods and at relatively low cost, is that of sap flow rate measurement (from now on Sap Flow Methods, see **Chapter 2 and 3** for details).  Sap flow methods are thermal based techniques that were first developed by Huber (1932), which have been further improved with different developed methodologies since then (e.g. Cermak 1973, Swanson and Whitfied 1981, Granier 1985). Sap flow methods estimates transpiration upscaling to the whole-plant the water flowing through tree steams. To do that, semi-invasive probes are installed in the trunk and heat is applied as a tracer of the sap flux. The quantification of the flux can be largely characterized into heat balance, heat dissipation, heat pulses or heat field deformation methods depending on how they calculate the flux (see **Chapter 2**, Vandegehuchte and Steppe 2013). Despite their advantages, all sap flow methods suffer from some methodological problems, they assume that the sensors installation does not alter the sap flow, and they rely on a correct determination of sapwood cross-sectional area to scale punctual measurements to the whole-tree level (Vandegehuchte and Steppe 2013, see **Chapter 2**). However, most of this issues can be addressed using specific calibration or by applying corrections (e.g. Clearwater et al. 1999, Richards et al. 2020).\par

Despite the potential of sap flow measures, the lack of a global compilation of sap flow measurements has precluded to use them to scale up plant water use strategies, and generalize actual tranpiration responses to environmental drivers, at the regional or global scale. Seminal works of sap flow data synthesis have only been able to focus on answering partial questions, for instance, on responses along climatic gradients within a species (Poyatos et al. 2007), or across some species, on responses to single hydroclimatic factors (Oren et al. 1999). However, the growing trend of data sharing for reuse, opened the door to the opportunity for the creation of a global collaborative database of sap flow measurements (Poyatos et al. 2016). A preliminar survey in Desember 2015, showed that >160 and >120 sites had potential shairing sap flow data sets with a global distribution (Poyatos et al. 2016). Thus, in 2016 the creation of the SAPFLUXNET database is initiated, with the intention of gathering, harmonizing and homogenizing (in a similar way to FLUXNET) the largest possible number of sap flow data sets at the whole-plant level together with hydrometeorological variables at the stand-level, and making them freely available to the scientific community.\par

##Transpiration in a changing world
The SAPFLUXNET database will allow us to study the regulation of transpiration to environmental changing conditions from a global perspective. It will enable the observation of broad patterns of plant’s water use strategies and improve predictions of vegetation responses to future climate scenarios. A first approach to understand global dynamics of regulation of transpiration at whole-plant level can be be done by using semi-empirical models of sap flow or canopy conductance (G) responses to atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, soil moisture or solar radiation daily changes. This approach allows to parameterize the plant's transpiration, obtaining specific maximum or reference values and sensitivities to hydroclimatic variables, thus defining the different water use strategies, its spatial distribution at a global level, and their physiological and ecological determinants. In addition, this approach may help to study which hydrometeorological variables are the main drivers of the regulation of transpiration (see **Chapter 4**) and its bio-geographical patterns, in such a way that the modeling efforts of, for example, LSMs, can be optimized and focused to the environmental variables with greater predictive power.\par

It is expected that water transport through the soil-plant-atmosphere and its regulation require of a coordination between stomatal behaviour and hydraulic traits (Meinzer 2002). This coordination is expected because vegetation has evolved to be adapted to the conditions of its typical climate, achieving a balance in its traits in such a way that they optimizes the transport of water and nutrients while maximizing $CO_2$ uptake and fitness (Manzoni et al. 2013). This coordination of traits at the organ level would determine the water use strategy that entire plant uses to cope drought. Thus, if there were a clear correlation between the hydraulic traits (some of which are easily measurable) and water use strategies, they could be used for parameterization of G on a continuous basis (see **Chapter 5**).\par

Therefore, a better understanding of transpiration and its regulation is key under the Earth’s system  uncertainty added by climate change and the expected increase in drought conditions widelly affecting terrestrial biomes (Dai 2013). It is expected that evaporation and precipitation will be globally intensified but unevenly distributed, which could trigger large forest mortality events, even in cold or wet places. This motivates further work to improve the predictability of global transpiration estimates, in order to obtain better predictions of vegetation trends and climate, so as to assist in decision-making for water resource management, climate change mitigation and forest management.\par

##Research aims and outline
In this thesis I address the question of whether we can find global patterns in transpiration regulation at plant and day level in response to hydrometeorological drivers using a global database of sap flow measurements, which will define different global plant water use strategies, and so generally hypothesizing that the differences will be related to ecosystem eco-hydrological conditions and to coordination with plant hydraulic traits (**Chapter 4 and 5**). To do that, I also tests the potential error of sap flow methods to test whether the different methods give comparable results and can be used together (**Chapter 2**). Besides, I performed, in collaboration with SAPFLUXNET core team, the data compilation of published and unpublished sap flow data sets required for Chapter 4 and 5, and develop an harmonization and data quality process (**Chapter 3**). The specific objectives for each chapter are listed bellow:\par

**Chapter 2**: To test whether there is systematic variability in sap flow measurements associated with the sap flow method employed. Here, (i) I compile all sap flow methodological calibrations obtained under laboratory or field conditions and perform a meta-analyses to obtain the mean systematic bias, the proportional bias, the linearity, and the precision of each method. In addition, I test whether (ii) the performance of each method is associated to wood anatomy or wood density.\par

**Chapter 3**: To introduce SAPFLUXNET and explain the database built from individual data sets contributed by the scientific community. We aim to (i) explain the data structure design, the data harmonization process and the workflow of the process, (ii) resume the main hydrometeorological drivers and metadata documented in each dataset, and (iii) discuss the potential applications of the database, its limitations, and future perspectives.\par

**Chapter 4**: To test the absolute and relative importance of vapour pressure deficit, soil moisture and solar radiation as drivers of tree transpiration at the global scale. I quantify the predictive skill of each hydrometeorological of plant level canopy conductance (G) using empirical models. I explain the differences in hydrometeorological coupling of G (i) across biomes and (ii) their biogeographical patterns as a function of climate, soil properties and vegetation structure.\par

**Chapter 5**: To explore water use strategies across tree species using a trait-based approach, by using a parameterization of the response of G to vapour pressure deficit and soil water content at the species level and for major taxonomic groups. I aim to understand how water use strategies emerge from the covariation between traits and the influence tree size and climate. We also characterize the relationships between transpiration regulation parameters and key hydraulic and allocation traits among species, controlling also for the effect produced by differences in precipitation.\par
