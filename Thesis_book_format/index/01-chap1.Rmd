##Transpiration and earth system functioning
Transpiration is a dynamic process in which water from plants evaporates and diffuses into the atmosphere. Transpiration occurs as a result of the need to incorporate carbon dioxide for assimilation in photosynthesis. This is because the carbon dioxide molecule is larger than the water molecule, and when it enters the plant tissues, water escapes through the same pathway. Given that plants require proper hydration to maintain physiological processes, water loss by transpiration determines the need to absorb and transport large quantities of water from the soil (@Prasad2008). Yet, transpiration  also contributes to regulate leaf temperature, keeping it within an tolerable range for leaf functioning. Thus, carbon uptake and transpiration water loss are inexorably linked and have to be dynamically controlled to avoid desiccation and maintain plant function. This control occurs on the long-term by changes in plant structure and anatomy, and in the short-term through the regulation of stomatal aperture in the leaves (@Jones1997). Stomata are small epidermal valves with a pore aperture that is usually regulated by plant water status and hydraulic characteristics (@Buckley2005; @Buckley2019). Stomata close to protect plants from excessive water loss when atmospheric humidity or water availability drops, but this closure increases physiological stress due to reduced carbon gain (@Breda2006; @McDowell2008). Transpiration, which is therefore determined in just a few micrometres in the leaves, but is the outcome of the plant integrated hydraulics and chemical signalling upstream, has crucial implications for biological processes at the whole-plant level such as growth, competition and survival. These influences scale up to the population and species level and determine the water, carbon and energy cycles from the local to the global level (@Bonan2003), which are essential cycles for the maintenance of life on Earth. Therefore, due to the relevance of transpiration patterns on climate and Earth system function it is crucial to correctly understand and model stomatal regulation and vegetation water use.\par

Within the global hydrological cycle, vegetation transpiration accounts for about 45,000 $\text{km}^3$ $\text{yr}^{-1}$ of water flowing from the soil to the atmosphere (@Schlesinger2014), which represents around a 40% of global terrestrial precipitation (@Oki2006). Vegetation is thus the major user of the precipitation and directly affects surface runoff and subsurface recharge. Transpiration accounts for about 61% of total terrestrial surface evapotranspiration (which is the sum of transpiration and the abiotic evaporation from canopy and soil surfaces). However, this proportion is highly variable within and among regions (@Schlesinger2014), which is largely explained by the different vegetation structures (e.g., leaf area index; @Wei2017) and water use strategies. Total land surface evapotranspiration and its partition between transpiration and evaporation drives other biosphere processes, such as vegetation dynamics or energy balance, that in turn produce feedbacks on evapotranspiration. For instance, transpiration is determinant of energy balance impacting in land surface temperature through changes in latent heat, and mediates land-atmosphere feedbacks via soil moisture depletion (@Miralles2019). It also promotes clouding formation (@Aemisegger2014) which alters regional albedo and influences large scale precipitation regimes (@Spracklen2012).\par

At the same time, climate affects vegetation physiology and how it regulates transpiration. Different tree species have a specific control of their stomata in response to environmental changes (@Klein2014), which means that the distribution of these species and their physiological traits will have consequences for ecosystem functioning and, ultimately, for global cycles. Environments with high regional water availability and resources generally support highly diverse and productive vegetation, whereas unfavourable environments support slow-growing vegetation and restrict species richness. Fast-growing plants tend to have higher transpiration rates (@Smith2014), and therefore accelerate the hydrological cycle. There is a large global heterogeneity both in space and time in water availability distribution, which drives heterogeneity in vegetation distribution and feedbacks on the spatio-temporal variability in transpiration patterns.\par

In addition to the water and energy cycles, transpiration is intimately linked to the carbon cycle through stomatal gas exchange. The carbon assimilated by plants in photosynthesis depends mainly on the internal leaves [$\text{CO}_2$], which enters the leaves by diffusion at a rate controlled by stomatal conductance (@Ball1987). At the plant level, carbon is used for growth and metabolism but drought-driven reductions in stomatal conductance limit the amount of carbon fixed by vegetation (@Breda2006).  Drought stress constrains ecosystem transpiration and photosynthesis, reducing the potential $\text{CO}_2$ uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (@Vandermolen2011). Transpiration could also be affected by atmospheric [$\text{CO}_2$], because as atmospheric [$\text{CO}_2$] increases, the ratio between carbon intake and water loss increases so that plants would theoretically maintain similar photosynthetic rates using less water, leading to more efficient water use (@Keenan2013). However, $\text{CO}_2$ effects on transpiration seem to be complex and ‘water savings’ not as clear (@Walker2020). In addition, current [$\text{CO}_2$] are approaching saturation levels of the Rubisco enzyme, at least for the $\text{C}_3$ plants, which implies that future increases in atmospheric [$\text{CO}_2$] will have progressively less impact on water use efficiency, and therefore on $\text{CO}_2$ transpiration constrain (@Flexas2015; @Sage2002).\par
 
Stomatal conductance ($g_s$) is therefore a central component of models characterizing land surface processes, since it is the main regulator of water, energy, carbon and nutrient fluxes between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere (@Knauer2015; @mencuccinimodelling2019). Thus, $g_s$ is used in many ecosystem and terrestrial biosphere models at multiple spatial and temporal scales. For example, it is included in Land Surface Models to resolve the effects of vegetation (@Matheny2017) on global climate models (@WangDickinson2012; @Fisher2020), or in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models to predict plant dynamics and vegetation distribution and changes under future climates (@Smith1992). Most ecosystem and terrestrial biosphere models are parametrized to separately estimate transpiration --calculated using diverse formulations of stomatal or canopy conductance ($G$) (@Knauer2015)--, soil evaporation and evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy or the litter layer. The mechanisms that regulate stomatal behaviour are still not completely understood, which is reflected in the different ways these processes are implemented in models. There are several approaches for modelling $g_s$ or $G$, from semi-empirical (@Damour2010), mechanistical (@Chuang2006) or models employing optimality criteria (@Wang2020). Early models, represented vegetation $g_s$ and $G$ responses with a static set of parameters across plant functional classes or climates (@Manzoni2011). This oversimplification of diverse species into functional classes leads these models to great uncertainties (@Poulter2011). Therefore, new modelling approaches are moving towards a more versatile characterization of vegetation which could represent the stomatal responses to environment emerging from an integration of hydraulic traits (which are increasingly available at the species level; @mencuccini_leaf_2019; @SanchezMartinez2020) at the whole-plant level. There is an increasing recognition that water transport from roots to leaves play a key role defining plant water use strategy and stomatal conductance regulation.\par

##Transpiration across scales
###Water transport in plants
The water in soil and plants moves under high tensions following the framework of the cohesion-tension theory (@Tyree1997). Water flow ($J$ [$\text{cm}^3$ $\text{s}^{-1}$]) between any two points of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum is given by its difference in $\Psi$ ($\Delta\Psi$) and the resistance --or its inverse, the hydraulic conductance ($K_{\text{H}}$ [$\text{cm}^3$ $\text{s}^{-1}$ $\text{MPa}^{-1}$])-- that the system exerts to the flow between these two points. This relationship can be expressed as $J = K_\text{H}\Delta\Psi$ which is an expression of Darcy’s law (@Scheidegger1974). Within the plant, water moves along a gradient of water potential ($\Psi$; normally negative in plant tissues) from high $\Psi$ in the soil (i.e. less negative) to lower $\Psi$ (i.e. more negative) in the leaves. Similarly, water diffuses out of the leaf and into the atmosphere following a gradient of water vapour concentration ($\Delta\Psi$, the difference in water mole fraction in the air, which could also be expressed as water potential, see e.g. @TyreeEwers1991). Water potential --measured as water pressure in Pascals (Pa)-- is the energy of water per unit volume compared to pure water and, along the soil-plant-atmosphere system, is the sum of hydrostatic potential, osmotic potential and gravitational potential. Hydrostatic potential is the physical pressure that the system exerts to the water and is positive inside turgid living cells but negative inside xylem conduits, a tissue conformed by dead cells and where water is under tension. The osmotic potential is related to a difference in solute concentration across a semi-permeable membrane, where the solution with more solutes has a lower $\Psi$. The gravitational potential arises because water ascent from soils to leaves must overcome gravity, but it is only important for tall trees (@Franks2004).\par

Transport of water in unsaturated soil also follows mass conservation and Darcy’s law. Water enters the roots mainly due to a gradient in hydrostatic pressure maintained largely by the transpiration stream (@Passioura1988). As soils dry out, the $\Psi$ of soils decreases because the matrix potential, i.e. the negative hydrostatic potential produced by the force by which water molecules are hold on surfaces, becomes more negative as the water layer covering soil particles becomes thinner. This decrease in soil $\Psi$ produces a parallel decrease in plant $\Psi$ in order to maintain water movement into the plant. Water absorbed by roots reaches xylem vessels, which by the hydrostatic pressure gradient generated by water evaporation in the leaves transported downstream. Water transport in plant tissues is therefore controlled by the combination of water potentials and plant-specific hydraulic conductivity ($k$), which is a measure of conductance per unit path length. Xylem $k$ is in turn dependent on water potential $k$($\Psi$), since cavitation and subsequent embolism formation occur at low $\Psi$, when the plant is under drought stress. Xylem $k$ declines non-linearly with $\Psi$ typically following a sigmoidal shape (vulnerability curve), which is characteristic of each species due to specific anatomical traits of the xylem (@venturas_plant_2017). Once in the leaves, water from the mesophyll, epidermis and guard cells evaporate into the stomatal cavity. The difference in $\Psi$ between the nearly water saturated stomatal cavity and the atmosphere represents the steepest potential gradient in all the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. It is in the plant-atmosphere interface, therefore, where the control of water loss is critical to avoid dangerous tensions in the plant tissues. Stomatal control and its link with plant hydraulics --but also anatomy, size, density and location of stomata-- determine plant water status (@McCulloh2019). The mechanistic control of stomata in response to environmental drivers is still not fully understood, although it appears quite evident that there are feedback processes (and probably feedforward processes) between stomatal conductance and leaf water status (@Jones1997; @Franks2004), and hormonal or chemical signalling from the roots to the leaves (@Tardieu1993).\par

Quantification of transpiration and stomatal control by leaves and canopies also require a careful consideration of aerodynamic processes involved in the vapour transfer between the leaves and the atmosphere. Leaf boundary layer conductance also controls the vapour transport between the leaf and the surrounding air, as this conductance occurs in series with $g_s$. Leaf boundary layer conductance depends on atmospheric turbulent flux inside the canopy and it is generally much higher than $g_s$, especially for trees and forests under well-ventilated conditions. Under these conditions, canopies are considered well-coupled to the atmosphere and transpiration is largely controlled by stomata. However, for large-leaved species under poor ventilation boundary layer conductance can be similar to stomatal conductance and this can affect estimations of the degree of stomatal control based on transpiration measurements. When dealing with whole plants and canopies, not with individual leaves, the sum of all the plant stomatal conductances and the boundary layer conductance can be considered as the whole-plant canopy conductance (@jarvis_stomatal_1986).\par

###Upscaling to the stand and ecosystem levels
The quantification of water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum from a micro-scale perspective (i.e. at the stomata-level) is a complex challenge due to the heterogeneity of the transporting medium and the different temporal scales of the water flux drivers (@Katul2007). Therefore, most studies on plant water transport have been undertaken at the organ (leaves) and the plant levels, observing emergent macroscopic responses of transpiration to environmental changes. Upscaling from the leaf to the ecosystem level requires consideration of processes that occur at the level of individual plants such as hydraulics. In addition, by using a whole-plant level perspective,  the micro-environmental and physiological gradients within the canopy are integrated, so we can focus on compositional, size-related patterns that influence the upscaling to the ecosystem. However, there is further challenge when trying to upscale both in space and time, due to the heterogeneity of the distribution of processes and the non-linearities of whole-plant responses shaped by the link between physiology and ecosystem functioning (@Jarvis1995). Thus, to scale up to ecosystem, regional or global level, we should make simplifications to allow a proper estimation of those processes distributions, either by a representation of the vegetation by functional types, or a description by hydraulic or functional traits. Both vegetation classes and traits are suitable for scaling up, but the latter is a more flexible approach since they are continuous variables, which overcome the rigidness of vegetation classes (i.e. functional type or species), and also allows to include intra-species environmental gradients and variability, and diversity within the ecosystem (@anderegg_hydraulic_2018).\par

##Transpiration quantification
There are several methods to quantify evaporative fluxes from the leaf to the ecosystem level (@Shuttleworth2008), which differ in their spatial and temporal domain and in their ability to separately measure transpiration and evapotranspiration. At the ecosystem level, continuous sub-daily estimations of evapotranspiration are usually performed using micrometeorological methods such as Bowen ration energy balance (@Bowen1926) and, mainly, Eddy covariance methods (@brutsaert_evaporation_1982), which are based on the measure of turbulence fluxes of latent heat and moisture (see @WangDickinson2012; @Kool2014; @Stoy2019; for further details). These methods have been standardized, and currently there is a global network of measuring stations (FLUXNET) that includes more than 900 sites worldwide (@Pastorello2020). The FLUXNET network initiative provides a valuable tool to study global land hydrological fluxes. However, micrometeorological methods do not allow to easily and directly separate transpiration from evaporation fluxes, thus requiring partitioning isotopic methods (@Kool2014) or complex algorithms to isolate the contribution of transpiration (@nelson_ecosystem_2020). Since some seminal works such as Sellers [-@Sellers1985], several attempts have been made to estimate regional transpiration and evapotranspiration patterns using remote sensing (@Miralles2011; @Miralles2016). Although remote sensing is the best method for containing continuous estimates of transpiration at large spatial scales, these estimations (e.g., GLEAM, @Martens2017) are indirect and based on the combination of remotely-sensed variables and models of vegetation responses and surface energy balance.\par

Since the 1970s, several methods have been developed to independently measure plant level transpiration, however most of them are impractical in the field, either because of their low temporal resolution and low ecological representativeness such as leaf gas exchange methods (@evans_prometheuswiki_2014), or because of their limited use on a broad scale due to their elevated cost such as whole-tree gas exchange chambers (@Corelli1993) or lysimeters (@Howell2005). Yet one method that can be applied continuously, unsupervised, for extended periods and at relatively low cost, is the measurement of sap flow rate (from now on Sap Flow Methods, see **Chapter 2 and 3** for details).  Sap flow methods are thermal-based techniques that were first developed by Huber [-@Huber1932], which have diversified into different methodologies since then (e.g. @cermak1973; @Swanson1981; @Granier1985). Sap flow methods basically apply to woody plants and estimate transpiration by measuring the water flowing through stems (@schulze_canopy_1985). To do that, semi-invasive probes are installed in the trunk and heat is applied as a tracer of the sap flux. The quantification of the flux can be largely characterized using 4 major variants: heat balance, heat dissipation, heat pulse or heat field deformation methods, which follow different operation principles, probe configuration, and method specific flux quantification (see **Chapter 2**; @Vandegehuchte2013). Despite their advantages, all sap flow methods suffer from potential methodological issues, they assume that the sensors installation does not alter the sap flow, and they rely on a correct determination of sapwood cross-sectional area to scale punctual measurements to the whole-tree level (see **Chapter 2**; @Vandegehuchte2013). However, most of these issues can be addressed using specific calibration and applying suitable corrections (e.g. @Clearwater1999; @Richard2020). Also, sap flow methods error have been associated with wood properties but not consistent patterns have been found (@Wullschleger2011).\par

Despite the potential of sap flow measures, the lack of a global compilation of sap flow measurements has precluded their use to scale up plant water use strategies and generalize actual transpiration responses to environmental drivers, at the regional or global scale. Similarly, a global sap flow database would allow a much better characterization of species’ water use strategies and the underlying functional traits. Seminal works of sap flow data synthesis have only been able to focus on answering partial questions, such as the characterization of transpiration responses along climatic gradients within a species (@Poyatos2007), or across a few species, typically addressing responses to single hydroclimatic factors (@Oren1999), or the various studies focused on maximum water use (@Manzoni2013). However, increased data availability and the growing trend of data sharing for reuse, has paved the way to the creation of a global collaborative database of sap flow measurements (@Poyatos2016). A preliminary survey conducted in December 2015 showed that potential contributors could provide data sets for >160 species and >120 globally distributed sites (@Poyatos2016). Thus, in 2016 the design of the first global database of sap flow measurements (SAPFLUXNET) was initiated, with the intention of gathering, harmonizing and homogenizing the largest possible number of sap flow data sets at the whole-plant level together with hydrometeorological variables at the stand-level, and making them freely available to the scientific community.\par

##Transpiration in a changing world
Forests are changing rapidly in response to climate change and all models predict that these changes will accelerate in the future (@Anderegg2020; @McDowell2020). Importantly an improved understanding of the regulation of tree water use is key to assess both species vulnerability and the functional changes expected under new climate regimes (@choat_triggers_2018; @Brodribb2020). The SAPFLUXNET database will allow us to study, for the first time, the regulation of whole-plant transpiration to environmental changing conditions from a global perspective. It will enable the observation of broad patterns of the water use strategies of woody plants and generate the knowledge to improve predictions of vegetation responses to future climate scenarios. A first approach to understand global dynamics of regulation of transpiration at the whole-plant level can be achieved by using semi-empirical models of sap flow or canopy conductance ($G$) responses to key environmental drivers, including atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, soil moisture and solar radiation. This approach would allow us to parameterize the plant's transpiration response, obtaining species-specific maximum values and sensitivities to hydroclimatic variables, and thus characterizing the corresponding water use strategies, their spatial distribution and their physiological and ecological determinants. In addition, this approach may help to study which hydrometeorological variables are the main drivers of the regulation of transpiration globally, as well as its bio-geographical patterns. In this way, modelling efforts, such as LSMs, could be optimized and focused on the responses to the environmental variables with greater predictive power.\par

It is expected that water transport through the soil-plant-atmosphere and its regulation require of a coordination between stomatal behaviour and hydraulic traits (@meinzer_co-ordination_2002). This coordination is expected because vegetation has evolved to be adapted to the conditions of its typical climate (@SanchezMartinez2020), achieving a balance in its traits in such a way that they optimize the transport of water and nutrients while maximizing $\text{CO}_2$ uptake and fitness (@Manzoni2013). This coordination of traits at the organ level would be a good basis to study the water use strategy that entire plant use to cope with drought, and would pave the way to trait-based models of vegetation water use at large spatial scales (@Eller2020; @Sperry2019). Thus, if there was a clear correlation between hydraulic traits (some of which are relatively easily to measure) and water use strategies, they could be used for parameterization of $G$ on a continuous basis.\par

Therefore, a better understanding of transpiration and its regulation is key under the Earth’s system  uncertainty added by global change and the expected increase in drought conditions (@Dai2013). It is expected that evaporation and precipitation will be globally intensified but unevenly distributed, which could trigger large forest mortality events, even in cold or wet places (@Allen2015). This motivates further work to improve the predictability of global transpiration estimates and vegetation drought responses, in order to obtain better predictions of vegetation dynamics and climate, so as to assist in decision-making for water resource management, climate change mitigation and forest management.\par

##Research aims and outline
In this thesis I address the question of whether we can find global patterns in daily transpiration regulation at the plant level in response to hydrometeorological drivers using a global database of sap flow measurements. The ultimate goal is to characterize the global variation in plant water use strategies and to relate this variation to ecosystem eco-hydrological conditions and to species traits, emphasizing plant water relations and hydraulics (**Chapter 4 and 5**). Prior to this synthesis work, I first assessed the suitability of sap flow methods as reliable estimators of the variation in plant water use (**Chapter 2**). And, last, but not least, together with the rest of the members of the SAPFLUXNET core team, I worked on the compilation and harmonization of the datasets in SAPFLUXNET database, which is also presented as part of this thesis (**Chapter 3**). The specific objectives for each research chapter are listed bellow:\par

**Chapter 2**: To test whether there is systematic variability in sap flow measurements associated with the sap flow method employed. Here, (i) I compile all sap flow methodological calibrations obtained under laboratory or field conditions and perform a meta-analysis to obtain the mean systematic bias, the proportional bias, the linearity, and the precision of each method. In addition, I test whether (ii) the performance of each method is associated to wood anatomy or wood density.\par

**Chapter 3**: To introduce SAPFLUXNET and explain how the database was built from individual data sets contributed by the scientific community. I (i) explain the data structure design, the data harmonization and quality control process and the overall workflow, (ii) summarise the main hydrometeorological drivers and metadata documented in each dataset, and (iii) discuss the potential applications of the database, its limitations, and future perspectives.\par

**Chapter 4**: To test the absolute and relative importance of vapour pressure deficit, soil moisture and solar radiation as drivers of tree transpiration at the global scale. I quantify the predictive capacity of each hydrometeorological driver of plant-level canopy conductance ($G$) using empirical models. I explain the differences in hydrometeorological coupling of $G$ (i) across biomes and (ii) their biogeographical patterns as a function of climate, soil properties and vegetation structure.\par

**Chapter 5**: To explore water use strategies across tree species using a trait-based approach, by parameterizing the response of $G$ to vapour pressure deficit and soil water content at the species level and for major taxonomic groups (angiosperms vs. gymnosperms). I aim to understand how water use strategies emerge from the covariation between traits, accounting for the influence of tree size and climate. I also characterize the relationships between transpiration regulation parameters and key hydraulic and allocation traits among species, controlling also for the effect produced by differences in precipitation.\par
