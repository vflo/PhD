abstract = {Forest evapotranspiration (ET) estimates that include scaled sap flux measurements often underestimate eddy covariance (EC)-measured latent heat flux (LE). We investigated potential causes for this bias using 4 years of coupled sap flux and LE measurements from a mature oak-hickory forest in North Carolina, USA. We focused on accuracy in sap flux estimates from heat dissipation probes by investigating nocturnal water uptake, radial pattern in flux rates, and sensor-to-stand scaling. We also produced empirical functions describing canopy interception losses (measured as the difference between precipitation and throughfall) and soil evaporation (based on wintertime eddy covariance fluxes minus wintertime water losses through bark), and added these components to the scaled sap flux to estimate stand evapotranspiration (ETS). We show that scaling based on areas in which the leaf area index of predominant species deviates from that of the EC footprint can lead to either higher or lower estimate of ETSthan LE (i.e. there is no bias). We found that accounting for nocturnal water uptake increased the estimate of growing season transpiration by an average of 22{\%}, with inter-annual standard deviation of 4{\%}. Annual ETSestimate that included sap flux corrected for nocturnal flux and scaled to the EC footprint were similar to LE estimates (633 ± 26 versus 604 ± 19 mm, respectively). At monthly or shorter time scales, ETSwas higher than LE at periods of low flux, similar at periods of moderate flux, and lower at periods of high flux, indicating potential shortcomings of both methods. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that accounting for the effects of nocturnal flux on the baseline signal was essential for eliminating much of the bias between EC-based and component-based estimates of ET, but the agreement between these estimates is greatly affected by the scaling procedure. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {AbstractThe land area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea has experienced 10 of the 12 driest winters since 1902 in just the last 20 years. A change in wintertime Mediterranean precipitation toward drier conditions has likely occurred over 1902?2010 whose magnitude cannot be reconciled with internal variability alone. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing are key attributable factors for this increased drying, though the external signal explains only half of the drying magnitude. Furthermore, sea surface temperature (SST) forcing during 1902?2010 likely played an important role in the observed Mediterranean drying, and the externally forced drying signal likely also occurs through an SST change signal.The observed wintertime Mediterranean drying over the last century can be understood in a simple framework of the region?s sensitivity to a uniform global ocean warming and to modest changes in the ocean?s zonal and meridional SST gradients. Climate models subjected to a uniform +0.5°C warming of the world oceans induce eastern Mediterranean drying but fail to generate the observed widespread Mediterranean drying pattern. For a +0.5°C SST warming confined to tropical latitudes only, a dry signal spanning the entire Mediterranean region occurs. The simulated Mediterranean drying intensifies further when the Indian Ocean is warmed +0.5°C more than the remaining tropical oceans, an enhanced drying signal attributable to a distinctive atmospheric circulation response resembling the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The extent to which these mechanisms and the region?s overall drying since 1902 reflect similar mechanisms operating in association with external radiative forcing are discussed.},

abstract = {Analyses of datasets throughout the temperate midlatitude regions show a widespread tendency for species to advance their springtime phenology, consistent with warming trends over the past 20-50 y. Within these general trends toward earlier spring, however, are species that either have insignificant trends or have delayed their timing. Various explanations have been offered to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to warming, including the influence of other abiotic cues (e.g., photoperiod) or reductions in fall/winter chilling (vernalization). Few studies, however, have explicitly attributed the historical trends of nonresponding species to any specific factor. Here, we analyzed long-term data on phenology and seasonal temperatures from 490 species on two continents and demonstrate that (i) apparent nonresponders are indeed responding to warming, but their responses to fall/winter and spring warming are opposite in sign and of similar magnitude; (ii) observed trends in first flowering date depend strongly on the magnitude of a given species' response to fall/winter vs. spring warming; and (iii) inclusion of fall/winter temperature cues strongly improves hindcast model predictions of long-term flowering trends compared with models with spring warming only. With a few notable exceptions, climate change research has focused on the overall mean trend toward phenological advance, minimizing discussion of apparently nonresponding species. Our results illuminate an understudied source of complexity in wild species responses and support the need for models incorporating diverse environmental cues to improve predictability of community level responses to anthropogenic climate change.},

abstract = {Although popular and scientific literature frequently assumes a strong connection between El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and good displays of spring-flowering annuals in the southwestern United States, such assumptions are based on anecdotal, short-term evidence. The goals of this study were to identify good wildflower years as objectively as possible, to assess the correlation between El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o and good displays of spring-flowering annuals, and to examine the influence of rainfall amounts on good wildflower years. The terms "good displays" and "good wildflower years" refer to times or places when populations of showy spring-flowering annuals (often called winter annuals) are abundant, robust, and diverse. In the deserts of southeastern California and southern Arizona, good wildflower years occurred about once every 5 to 7 years in the 20th century. The connection between good wildflower years and traditionally defined El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o episodes was weak, but when El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o was redefined in a phenologically meaningful way as any calendar year in which the average Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) between July and December was negative, 21 of 27 good wildflower years in the combined deserts were associated with El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o. Good wildflower years were 3.6 times more likely after redefined El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o years than after other years. Rain in the months before good wildflower years was at least 30{\%} greater than the long-term average in the Mojave Desert and at least 50{\%} greater in the Sonoran Desert. A diverse flora of spring-flowering annuals occurred in the region during the late Wisconsin and early Holocene, which was a period of wetter, milder winters and cooler summers. Perhaps some species of spring-flowering annuals persist today in the arid southwestern United States only because frequent El Ni{\&}{\#}xf1;o conditions recreate the cool, moist conditions of the late Pleistocene.},

abstract = {In sap flow studies, there is no method complying with high efficiency and versatility of sap flow measurements. To improve that, we propose combining two methods: (1) thermal dissipation probe (TDP) known to be efficient and cost effective and (2) heat field deformation (HFD) known to be versatile. For that purpose, we used a step-wise TDP sap flux density (Jp) optimization method consisting of (1) natural temperature gradient (NTG) correction applying the cyclic heat dissipation (CHD) method, (2) night flow $\Delta$Tmax correction using HFD data as reference and (3) radial-azimuthal correction using HFD as reference. We applied this optimization method on Quercus ilex (Q.i.) and Quercus pyrenaica (Q.p.) trees in a Spanish semi-arid open woodland during dry season. The NTG correction resulted in substantial reduction of Jp as compared with standard TDP. The subsequent $\Delta$Tmax night flow correction resulted in the increase of NTG-corrected Jp and good agreement with the outermost 2 cm of HFD measurements for both species. The final radial-azimuthal adjustment of TDP Jp resulted not only, in a good agreement with HFD Jp, but also provided novel ecohydrological insights such as: (1) evidence of continuous night flow in all Q.p. trees and some Q.i. trees, (2) exponential reduction of Jp with sapwood depth for both species, (3) significantly larger Jp in the outermost 1 cm of sapwood for Q.p. than for Q.i. and (4) high azimuthal Jp variability for both species. The presented study offers efficient and versatile method of tree sap flow measurements that contributed to a better understanding of water-related dynamics of Q.i. and Q.p. under water-stress conditions.

abstract = {Transpiration rates for whole plants, individual branches or tillers can be determined by techniques which measure the rate at which sap ascends stems. All of these methods use heat as a tracer for sap movement, but they are fundamentally different in their operating principles. Two methods commonly employed, the stem heat balance and trunk sector heat balance methods, use the heat balance principle; the stem is heated electrically and the heat balance is solved for the amount of heat taken up by the moving sap stream, which is then used to calculate the mass flow of sap in the stem. In the heat-pulse method, rather than using continuous heating, short pulses of heat are applied and the mass flow of sap is deter- mined from the velocity of the heat pulses moving along the stem. In addition, rates of sap flow can be determined empirically, using the thermal dissipation technique, from the temperature of sapwood near a continuously-powered heater implanted in the stem. Users must understand the theory underlying each of these methods, so that they can select the method most appropriate to their application and take pre- cautions against potential sources of error. When attempting to estimate transpiration by stands of vegetation from measurements of sap flow in individual plants, users must also select an appropriate sampling strategy and scaling method. Key},

abstract = {Recent contradicting evidence on the contributions of xylem and phloem to tomato fruit growth highlights the need for a more thorough insight into the dynamics of sap flow through the tomato peduncle. In fact, knowledge on sap flow dynamics through small plant parts remains scarce, due to a lack of direct measurements. Most currently available sap flow sensors use needles, making them inappropriate for the direct measurement of sap flow through small plant parts such as a tomato peduncle. Therefore, a non-invasive sap flow sensor based on the heat field deformation (HFD) principle was tested on the peduncle of a tomato truss. This mini HFD sensor, consisting of a heater element and three thermocouples stitched on insulation tape, was wrapped around the peduncle and allowed continuous monitoring of changes in the heat field around the heater caused by sap flow. Actual influx into the tomato truss was calculated based on fruit growth data and estimates of fruit transpiration and was compared with the dynamics measured with the mini HFD sensor. Additionally, heat girdling of the peduncle was performed to block phloem influx to study the dynamics of xylem and phloem influx using the mini HFD sensor. First results of the mini HFD sensor were promising and the measured sap flow dynamics through the tomato peduncle agreed well with the calculated sap influx. Results of the girdling experiment suggested opposite patterns of xylem and phloem influx, with a decreased xylem influx during the daytime. Furthermore, the pattern of xylem influx revealed a close relation with the total water potential in the stem. As such, the mini HFD sensor provided direct measurements of sap flow dynamics through a tomato peduncle and, hence, has a large potential to finally resolve the controversy on water influx into developing fruits.},

abstract = {Assessing the relative contributions to seed set for each of a plant species' floral visitors provides an indication of the relative influence of these visitors on the plant's reproductive success. This study examined pollinator activity and seed set in a population of Heterotheca subaxillaris, a species that exhibits a floret dimorphism (heads bearing disk and ray florets), and that is visited by both generalist foragers and specialist bees. Visits by nine bee genera and one genus of skipper were recorded in the study population. During the period of study, these insects varied in their relative abundance, in their foraging activity on a head, and in their pollination effectiveness. The pattern of pollination effectiveness shown by the different pollinators was similar for both floret types, although seed set was higher overall for ray florets. Pollinator importance, calculated as the product of pollination effectiveness and relative abundance, was dictated by a pollinator's relative abundance. The single specialist bee species observed in the study population proved to have neither higher pollination effectiveness nor higher pollinator abundance than other pollinators. This would suggest that H. subaxillaris is not under strong selective pressure to co-specialize with its specialist visitor.},

abstract = {Transpiration rates of two 7-year-old kiwifruit vines (Actinidia deliciosa) and a 10-year-old apple tree (Malus sylvestris × Red delicious) were measured for 15 days in summer using the heat-pulse technique. Environmental data were collected at the same time, every half-hour. Significant transpiration rates were observed at night, in both kiwifruit and apple, whenever the saturation deficit remained elevated. Night-time water use in kiwifruit plants ranged from 1.4 to 19.2 l, for saturation deficits of between 0.44 and 3.1 g kg-1. Nocturnal transpiration of the apple tree ranged from 0.3 to 5.3 l for saturation deficits between 0.2 and 3.3 g kg-1. Mean night-time water use for kiwifruit and apple was 19{\%} (n = 15 nights) and 6{\%} (n = 15), respectively of the total daily transpiration. Nocturnal transpiration increased linearly with mean saturation deficit and saturation deficit increased with mean wind speed. Nocturnal transpiration was therefore greater on windy nights. The directly measured nocturnal transpiration rates in kiwifruit were compared with rates of water use calculated using the Penman-Monteith combination equation with stomatal resistance data obtained by porometry on one night. There was satisfactory agreement between the two results. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

Previous experience had shown that the velocity profile across the conducting area cannot be assumed to be constant, necessitating several such point estimates for a reasonable characterization of the velocity profile with depth. These point estimates must be integrated over the sapwood conducting area to derive flux. The most common method is to fit a one degree of freedom least-squares polynomial to the point estimates, and then to integrate this equation across the sapwood profile and around the bole. An alternative method is presented based on a weighted average approach, illustrated with sapflow velocity data collected for two radiata pine (Pinus radiata) trees. This method is shown to be a more robust estimator of flux when velocity profiles exhibit large curvatures.},

abstract = {Sap flow measurements conducted with thermal dissipation probes (TDPs) are vulnerable to natural temperature gradient (NTG) bias. Few studies, however, attempted to explain the dynamics underlying the NTG formation and its influence on the sensors' signal. This study focused on understanding how the TDP signals are affected by negative and positive temperature influences from NTG and tested the novel cyclic heat dissipation (CHD) method to filter out the NTG bias. A series of three experiments were performed in which gravity-driven water flow was enforced on freshly cut stem segments of Fagus sylvatica L., while an artificial temperature gradient (ATG) was induced. The first experiment sought to confirm the incidence of the ATG on sensors. The second experiment established the mis-estimations caused by the biasing effect of the ATG on standard TDP measurements. The third experiment tested the accuracy of the CHD method to account for the ATG biasing effect, as compared with other cyclic correction methods. During experiments, sap flow measured by TDP was assessed against gravimetric measurements. The results show that negative and positive ATGs were comparable in pattern but substantially larger than field NTGs. Second, the ATG bias caused an overestimation of the standard TDP sap flux density of ∼17 cm(3) cm(-2) h(-1) by 76{\%}, and the sap flux density of ∼2 cm(3) cm(-2) h(-1) by over 800{\%}. Finally, the proposed CHD method successfully reduced the max. ATG bias to 25{\%} at ∼11 cm(3) cm(-2) h(-1) and to 40{\%} at ∼1 cm(3) cm(-2) h(-1). We concluded that: (i) the TDP method is susceptible to NTG especially at low flows; (ii) the CHD method successfully corrected the TDP signal and resulted in generally more accurate sap flux density estimates (mean absolute percentage error ranging between 11 and 21{\%}) than standard constant power TDP method and other cyclic power methods; and (iii) the ATG enforcing system is a suitable way of re-creating NTG for future tests.},

abstract = {Whole-plant water use provides a baseline for a plant's irrigation requirement. The measurement of whole-plant water use in tree crops is much more difficult than in field crops, owing mainly to their large size. The development of thermo-electrical methods for xylem sap flow measurement has provided tree physiologists with an accurate and convenient tool to study whole-tree water use and water relations. However, sap flow measurement in orchard grown trees is particularly challenging because of horticultural practices, such as grafting, training and structural pruning. Whole-tree water use on a range of tropical and subtropical tree crops, such as mango, cashew, mangosteen, banana and macadamia, was measured using a Granier sap flow measuring system. The Granier system was found suitable for tree crops with very diverse morphologies and xylem structures, e.g. mango, mangosteen and banana. For a given species, radial variation in water flux in the sapwood has a more or less regular pattern, but the circumferential (aspect) variation was substantial and random. To obtain a reasonable estimate of the whole-plant or orchard water use, a large number of sap flow sensors and several dataloggers are required. To assist in taking account of spatial variabilities, a modified Granier method was developed and proved to be effective. A summary of the quantitative estimates of the whole-plant water use of several tropical and subtropical crops was provided. Sap flow was found to be a very sensitive indicator of plant water status useful for irrigation scheduling for plants grown in containers or on soil with limited soil water holding capacity but was not so sensitive for plants with deep roots and/or on soil with high water holding capacity. In its current design the sap flow system should remain as a research tool for researchers rather than an irrigation scheduling tool for farmers.$\backslash$n},

Our objectives were to assess the importance of different sources of variability on transpiration upscaling and explore the potential impacts of future shifts in species composition on the forest water budget. We measured sap velocity in five tree species (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., Acer rubrum L., Acer saccharum Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, and Betula papyrifera Marsh.) in a mature stand and a young stand in New Hampshire, USA.

Flowers were counted every other day for most or all of the growing season in seven plots in a rocky meadow habitat and nine plots in a wet meadow habitat. The phenology and abundance of flowering were both highly variable, with mean dates of first flowering ranging from 16 May to 12 July and maximum daily counts of flowers ranging from 1 to 1187. Snowmelt date was the primary determinant of timing of flowering. For rocky meadow plots, the previous year's summer precipitation and the current year's average minimum temperature in May had significant effects on maximum number of flowers produced, but no environmental variable we considered was significantly correlated with flower abundance in the wet meadow plots. Length of flowering in individual plots ranged from 2 to 85 d, and many plot-years had both primary (about 1 mo) and secondary (about 10-12 d) flowering periods. The predicted increase in variability of precipitation accompanying climate change will affect negatively the long-term abundance and persistence of this species at our study site.},

abstract = {Tertiary macrofossils of the flowering plant family Leguminosae (legumes) were used as time constraints to estimate ages of the earliest branching clades identified in separate plastid matK and rbcL gene phylogenies. Penalized likelihood rate smoothing was performed on sets of Bayesian likelihood trees generated with the AIC-selected GTR+ Gamma +I substitution model. Unequivocal legume fossils dating from the Recent continuously back to about 56 million years ago were used to fix the family stem clade at 60 million years (Ma), and at 1-Ma intervals back to 70 Ma. Specific fossils that showed distinctive combinations of apomorphic traits were used to constrain the minimum age of 12 specific internal nodes. These constraints were placed on stem rather than respective crown clades in order to bias for younger age estimates. Regardless, the mean age of the legume crown clade differs by only 1.0 to 2.5 Ma from the fixed age of the legume stem clade. Additionally, the oldest caesalpinioid, mimosoid, and papilionoid crown clades show approximately the same age range of 39 to 59 Ma. These findings all point to a rapid family-wide diversification, and predict few if any legume fossils prior to the Cenozoic. The range of the matK substitution rate, 2.1-24.6 x 10(-10) substitutions per site per year, is higher than that of rbcL, 1.6- 8.6 x 10(-10), and is accompanied by more uniform rate variation among codon positions. The matK and rbcL substitution rates are highly correlated across the legume family. For example, both loci have the slowest substitution rates among the mimosoids and the fastest rates among the millettioid legumes. This explains why groups such as the millettioids are amenable to species-level phylogenetic analysis with these loci, whereas other legume groups are not.},

abstract = {It is well known that increased spring temperatures cause earlier onset dates of leaf unfolding and flowering. However, a temperature increase in winter may be associated with delayed development when species' chilling requirements are not fulfilled. Furthermore, photosensitivity is supposed to interfere with temperature triggers. To date, neither the relative importance nor possible interactions of these three factors have been elucidated. In this study, we present a multispecies climate chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling and photoperiod on the spring phenology of 36 woody species. Several hypotheses regarding their variation with species traits (successional strategy, floristic status, climate of their native range) were tested. Long photoperiods advanced budburst for one-third of the studied species, but magnitudes of these effects were generally minor. In contrast to prior hypotheses, photosensitive responses were not restricted to climax or oceanic species. Increased chilling length advanced budburst for almost all species; its effect greatly exceeding that of photoperiod. Moreover, we suggest that photosensitivity and chilling effects have to be rigorously disentangled, as the response to photoperiod was restricted to individuals that had not been fully chilled. The results indicate that temperature requirements and successional strategy are linked, with climax species having higher chilling and forcing requirements than pioneer species. Temperature requirements of invasive species closely matched those of native species, suggesting that high phenological concordance is a prerequisite for successful establishment. Lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in budburst but also caused substantial changes in the chronological order of species' budburst. The results reveal that increased winter temperatures might impact forest ecosystems more than formerly assumed. Species with lower chilling requirements, such as pioneer or invasive species, might profit from warming winters, if late spring frost events would in parallel occur earlier.},

@article{Wullschleger1998,
abstract = {Weighing lysimeters, large-tree potometers, ventilated chambers, radioisotopes, stable isotopes and an array of heat balance/heat dissipation methods have been used to provide quantitative estimates of whole-tree water use. A survey of 52 studies conducted since 1970 indicated that rates of water use ranged from 10 kg day−1 for trees in a 32-year-old plantation of Quercus petraea L. ex Liebl. in eastern France to 1,180 kg day−1 for an overstory Euperua purpurea Bth. tree growing in the Amazonian rainforest. The studies included in this survey reported whole-tree estimates of water use for 67 species in over 35 genera. Almost 90{\%} of the observations indicated maximum rates of daily water use between 10 and 200 kg day−1 for trees that averaged 21 m in height. The thermal techniques that made many of these estimates possible have gained widespread acceptance, and energy-balance, heat dissipation and heat-pulse systems are now routinely used with leaf-level measurements to investigate the relative importance of stomatal and boundary layer conductances in controlling canopy transpiration, whole-tree hydraulic conductance, coordinated control of whole-plant water transport, movement of water to and from sapwood storage, and whole-plant vulnerability of water transport to xylem cavitation. Techniques for estimating whole-tree water use complement existing approaches to calculating catchment water balance and provide the forest hydrologist with another tool for managing water resources. Energy-balance, heat dissipation and heat-pulse methods can be used to compare transpiration in different parts of a watershed or between adjacent trees, or to assess the contribution of transpiration from overstory and understory trees. Such studies often require that rates of water use be extrapolated from individual trees to that of stands and plantations. The ultimate success of this extrapolation depends in part on whether data covering short time sequences can be applied to longer periods of time. We conclude that techniques for estimating whole-tree water use have provided valuable tools for conducting basic and applied research. Future studies that emphasize the use of these techniques by both tree physiologists and forest hydrologists should be encouraged.},

abstract = {Soil moisture supply and atmospheric demand for water independently limit—and profoundly affect—vegetation productivity and water use during periods of hydrologic stress1, 2, 3, 4. Disentangling the impact of these two drivers on ecosystem carbon and water cycling is difficult because they are often correlated, and experimental tools for manipulating atmospheric demand in the field are lacking. Consequently, the role of atmospheric demand is often not adequately factored into experiments or represented in models5, 6, 7. Here we show that atmospheric demand limits surface conductance and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture in many biomes, including mesic forests that are of particular importance to the terrestrial carbon sink8, 9. Further, using projections from ten general circulation models, we show that climate change will increase the importance of atmospheric constraints to carbon and water fluxes in all ecosystems. Consequently, atmospheric demand will become increasingly important for vegetation function, accounting for {\textgreater}70{\%} of growing season limitation to surface conductance in mesic temperate forests. Our results suggest that failure to consider the limiting role of atmospheric demand in experimental designs, simulation models and land management strategies will lead to incorrect projections of ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.},

abstract = {Robust thermal dissipation sensors of variable length (3 to 30 cm) were developed to overcome limitations to the measurement of radial profiles of sap flow in large-diameter tropical trees with deep sapwood. The effective measuring length of the custom-made sensors was reduced to 1 cm at the tip of a thermally nonconducting shaft, thereby minimizing the influence of nonuniform sap flux density profiles across the sapwood. Sap flow was measured at different depths and circumferential positions in the trunks of four trees at the Parque Natural Metropolitano canopy crane site, Panama City, Republic of Panama. Sap flow was detected to a depth of 24 cm in the trunks of a 1-m-diameter Anacardium excelsum (Bertero {\&} Balb. ex Kunth) Skeels tree and a 0.65-m-diameter Ficus insipida Willd. tree, and to depths of 7 cm in a 0.34-m-diameter Cordia alliodora (Ruiz {\&} Pav.) Cham. trunk, and 17 cm in a 0.47-m-diameter Schefflera morototoni (Aubl.) Maguire, Steyerm. {\&} Frodin trunk. Sap flux density was maximal in the outermost 4 cm of sapwood and declined with increasing sapwood depth. Considerable variation in sap flux density profiles was observed both within and among the trees. In S. morototoni, radial variation in sap flux density was associated with radial variation in wood properties, particularly vessel lumen area and distribution. High variability in radial and circumferential sap flux density resulted in large errors when measurements of sap flow at a single depth, or a single radial profile, were used to estimate whole-plant water use. Diurnal water use ranged from 750 kg H2O day-1 for A. excelsum to 37 kg H2O day-1 for C. alliodora.},

The values of sap flow were compared to the transpiration measured by lysimeters at integrated intervals of 1, 2, 4 and 24 h. The heat balance method showed good precision for estimating daily transpiration (R-2 = 0.95 and R-2 = 0.90), accompaning the availability of energy in the system, underestimating on average 4.6{\%} of the daily transpiration in orange plants and overestimating in about 0.3{\%} the daily transpiration of mango plants under conditions of good water supply. The heat balance method underestimated by 16{\%} the transpiration in orange under conditions of water deficit.},

O'Henry] trees under field conditions. On rare occasions, heat balance estimates agreed well with independent lysimetric measurements, but on most occasions, heat balance estimates of sap flow were unrealistic in both direction and magnitude. In some cases, the errors in sap flow approached two orders of magnitude and were always the result of a calculation involving division by a very small and sometimes negative temperature differential between the stem surface temperature above and below the gauge heater. The occurrence of negative temperature differentials under positive transpiration conditions may be inconsistent with a fundamental assumption in the heat balance model, namely that temperature differentials are solely a consequence of the dissipation of energy supplied to the gauge heater. In the absence of heating power applied to the gauge, temperature differentials exceeding - 1C were correlated with the rate of change in stem temperature, indicating that ambient conditions themselves can impose a bias in gauge signals and, hence, influence gauge accuracy. Our results suggest that the effect of ambient conditions on gauge signals should be critically evaluated before considering heat balance estimates of sap flow as reliable under any given conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract: The Heat Field Deformation (HFD) technique is a thermodynamic method for measuring sap flow. Based on continuous heating the HFD method allows for high time resolution measurements which are highly important when studying plant responses to abrupt environmental changes. This work provides a succinct review of previously described features of the HFD methodology. Analyzing symmetrical and asymmetrical temperature differences around a measured linear heater (dTsym and dTas) relative to their ratio dTsym/dTas (so called a K-diagram) is at the heart of this methodology. This key concept, however, has to date only been generally described in previous works on the HFD technique. My objective here is to provide a comprehensive overview describing different types of K-diagrams, their interpretation and application for determining K-values or dTas for a zero flow condition. The K-value is a measured parameter which is particularly important for objectively characterizing heat conducting properties at the sensor insertion point under specific local measurement conditions. Correctly determining the K-value is critical for accurately calculating sap flow based on recorded temperature measurements. I have included in this review several examples demonstrating how the K-value is dependent upon changes to the environment and its important role in sap flow estimation.},

abstract = {In citrus trees, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) can be a useful irrigation strategy to reduce water supply without affecting yield. Previous studies conducted in this sense have determined irrigation water savings achieved by RDI but less is known about the actual transpiration values of the RDI trees. This information is crucial to properly carry out a water balance of an RDI orchard. In an experiment performed during 2009 on mature 'Clementina de Nules' citrus, we determined sap flow (SF) of well irrigated and RDI trees by means of the compensation heat pulse method. SF was measured in two trees per treatment instrumented with one unit of two different gauge types per tree, determining heat velocity at four different xylem depths. SF values obtained at 30-min intervals during the entire experimental period were compared with whole canopy gas exchange measurements carried out during two representative days with custom designed Mylar plastic chambers. Plant water status was determined by midday stem water potential measurements (Psi(stem)). Results showed that absolute SF values clearly underestimated tree water use. After calibrating SF against canopy gas exchange determinations, corrected SF values appeared more reasonable but it also increased tree-to-tree variability (CV from 0.08 to 0.17). The transpiration ratio (SFRDI/SFcontrol) had a somewhat decreasing trend during the water restriction period according to Psi(stem), but recovering before the irrigation was resumed to normal dose. Overall, the results highlight some of the problems and uncertainties when using a limited number of sap flow sensors for detecting plant water stress and for accurately measuring transpiration.},

abstract = {Thermal methods, including heat-pulse, have been used to measure sap flow for many decades. In most cases, analysis and interpretation of the temperature signals has remained largely unchanged since the pioneering work of Marshall (1958) and the theoretical calibrations of Swanson and Whitfield (1983). Two recent advances to heat-pulse have been developed to improve measurements at low flows; the ‘Average Gradient' method (CAG) of Villalobos and Testi (2008), which modified the ‘compensation method' (CHP) to improve sensitivity at low flows (i.e. {\textless} 10 cm h-1), and the ‘Heat Ratio Method' (HRM) of Burgess et al. (2001) which employs temperature ratios measured at equal distances either side of the heater source. Preliminary results from CHP, CAG and HRM are compared against lysimeter data from potted trees to demonstrate the performance of these methods across a range of flows. We also propose and test two new methods to resolve low sap flow. The first method we will call the Symmetrical Gradient method (SGM). It consists of averaging the temperature-difference signal ($\Delta$T) of two probes that are equidistant from the heater. The second method we will call the Maximum Derivative Method (MDM). The analysis of MDM is based on the maximum rate of change of the temperature difference curve (i.e. the derivative, $\Delta$T'max). We have applied this derivative approach to temperature data collected using both symmetrical and assymetrical probe arrangements. Our measurements suggest these two indicators ($\Delta$T and $\Delta$T'max) are proportional to the sap flow across a wide range of flows. Data suggests our new ‘calibrated maximum derivative' CMD method (CMD), is a simple and practical means to extend CHP over the low-flow regime.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some of the most exciting advances in pollination biology have resulted from interdisciplinary research combining ecological and evolutionary perspectives. For example, these two approaches have been essential for understanding the functional ecology of floral traits, the dynamics of pollen transport, competition for pollinator services, and patterns of specialization and generalization in plant-pollinator interactions. However, as research in these and other areas has progressed, many pollination biologists have become more specialized in their research interests, focusing their attention on either evolutionary or ecological questions. We believe that the continuing vigour of a synthetic and interdisciplinary field like pollination biology depends on renewed connections between ecological and evolutionary approaches. SCOPE: In this Viewpoint paper we highlight the application of ecological and evolutionary approaches to two themes in pollination biology: (1) links between pollinator behaviour and plant mating systems, and (2) generalization and specialization in pollination systems. We also describe how mathematical models and synthetic analyses have broadened our understanding of pollination biology, especially in human-modified landscapes. We conclude with several suggestions that we hope will stimulate future research. This Viewpoint also serves as the introduction to this Special Issue on the Ecology and Evolution of Plant-Pollinator Interactions. These papers provide inspiring examples of the synergy between evolutionary and ecological approaches, and offer glimpses of great accomplishments yet to come.},

abstract = {Shifts in species' phenology in response to climate change have wide-ranging consequences for ecological systems. However, significant variability in species' responses, together with limited data, frustrates efforts to forecast the consequences of ongoing phenological changes. Herein, we use a case study of three North American plant communities to explore the implications of variability across levels of organisation (within and among species, and among communities) for forecasting responses to climate change. We show how despite significant variation among species in sensitivities to climate, comparable patterns emerge at the community level once regional climate drivers are accounted for. However, communities differ with respect to projected patterns of divergence and overlap among their species' phenological distributions in response to climate change. These analyses and a review of hypotheses suggest how explicit consideration of spatial scale and levels of biological organisation may help to understand and forecast phenological responses to climate change.},

abstract = {Osmia lignaria is a solitary bee that over-winters as a fully eclosed, cocooned, unfed adult. Our objective is to understand the effect of wintering temperature on diapause maintenance and termination in this species. We measure respiration rates and weight loss in individuals exposed to various wintering temperatures (0, 4, 7, 22 °C, outdoors) and durations (28, 84, 140, 196, 252 days). We use time to emerge and respiration response (respiration rate measured at 22 °C) as indicators of diapause intensity. Adults spontaneously lower their respiration rates to ∼0.1 ml/g h within 1 month after adult eclosion, indicating obligatory diapause. Non-wintered individuals maintain low respiration rates, but lose weight rapidly and die by mid-winter. In wintered adults, two phases can be distinguished. First, respiration response undergoes a rapid increase and then reaches a plateau. This phase is similar in bees wintered at 0, 4 and 7 °C. In the second phase, respiration response undergoes an exponential increase, which is more pronounced at the warmer temperatures. Composite exponential functions provide a good fit to the observed respiration patterns. Adults whose respiration response has reached 0.45 ml/g h emerge promptly when exposed to 20 °C, indicating diapause completion. Individuals wintered for short periods do not reach such respiration levels. When exposed to 20 °C these individuals lower their metabolic rate, and their emergence time is extended. The relationship between respiration rates and emergence time follows a negative exponential function. We propose two alternative models of diapause termination to interpret these results.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The showiness of floral displays is usually explained as an adaptation to attract pollinators. However, selection for less attractive displays imposed by non-pollinating agents, particularly herbivores, may balance pollinator-driven selection for highly visible inflorescences. We investigated whether inflorescence architecture, particularly the unusual ground-level flowering associated with a specialized bird perch in Babiana ringens may have originated, in part, as an adaptive response to mammalian herbivory.

METHODS: We measured levels of herbivory by antelope in populations of B. hirsuta, the putative sister species of B. ringens, which possesses the likely ancestral form of inflorescence architecture. To test for position-dependent effects of herbivory on flowers, we compared the herbivory rates and seed production of manipulated inflorescences in a field experiment. We predicted that flowers at the base of inflorescences would suffer less herbivory than those in apical positions.

RESULTS: We found herbivore damage to flowers in 50{\%} of naturally occurring B. hirsuta plants. Manipulated inflorescences with only basal flowers, and consequently similar inflorescence architecture to B. ringens, experienced significantly lower herbivory and higher seed set than inflorescences manipulated to have only apical flowers.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that position-dependent herbivory on inflorescences could have played a role in the evolution of inflorescence design. More specifically, position-dependent herbivory may have selected for the loss of apical flowers. Position-dependent herbivory may have contributed toward the evolution of a naked inflorescence axis, a structure that characterizes B. ringens and functions as a bird perch facilitating cross-pollination by sunbirds.},

abstract = {Forested riparian buffers are prevalent throughout the Southeastern Coastal Plain Region of the United States (US). Vegetation in the riparian forest buffers in this region are primarily made up of slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) trees. Because they make up a significant portion of the regional landscape, transpiration within these riparian buffers is believed to have an important impact on the hydrologic budget of regional watersheds. A riparian buffer along a first order stream in South-central Georgia US was selected for a sap flow study designed to provide measurements of tree transpiration. The forest provided a buffer zone that averaged 70m in width from an upland field to the first order stream. Shallow water table conditions allowed direct interaction between the tree's root system and groundwater. Sap flux density, groundwater, and climatic data were collected to determine transpiration rates from different tree species and their relationship to potential ET rates and hydrologic and environmental conditions. Average sap flow rates ranged from 2 to 142Lday-1. Sap flow was related to tree diameter, solar flux density, and daily vapor pressure deficit. An exponential relationship was developed that related measured average daily sap flow rate (Lday-1) to tree diameter at breast height (DBH) (mm) for the range of measured trees (56{\textless}DBH{\textless}390mm) with a coefficient of 2.04 and an exponent of 0.01. On an area basis, the average transpiration for the studied 720m2 study area was 1114mm for the observation period from April to December. This represented 103{\%} of the potential evapotranspiration for a reference grass (PET) for that same period. While landscape position, and subsequently access to groundwater, did not appear to strongly influence sap flow rates, reduced soil water in the vadose zone led to reductions in tree transpiration. The data indicate that transpiration within regional buffers uses a disproportionate amount of water on a per area basis compared to upland land covers, an important consideration when examining overall water consumption in regional watersheds. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

This lethal event is prevented by a highly conserved checkpoint involving an unknown, caffeine-sensitive mediator. Here, we have examined the possible involvement of the caffeine-sensitive ATM and ATR protein kinases in this checkpoint. We show that caffeine's ability to inhibit ATR (but not ATM) causes PCC, that ATR (but not ATM) prevents PCC, and that ATR prevents PCC via Chk-1 regulation. Moreover, mimicking cancer cell phenotypes by disrupting normal G(1) checkpoints sensitizes cells to PCC by ATR inhibition plus low-dose DNA damage. Notably, loss of p53 function potently sensitizes cells to PCC caused by ATR inhibition by a small molecule. We present a molecular model for how ATR prevents PCC and suggest that ATR represents an attractive therapeutic target for selectively killing cancer cells by premature chromatin condensation.},

During daylight hours and under well-watered conditions, rates of sap flow (0.1-0.5 kg h(-1)) measured by the established compensation heat-pulse method (CHPM) and the newly developed heat-ratio method (HRM) were similar to rates measured with a weighing lysimeter, and most of the time there was no significant difference (P {\textless} 0.001) between methods. The HRM accurately described sap flow at night when rates of flow were low ({\textless} 0.1 kg h(-1)) or near zero, but the CHPM was unable to measure low rates of sap flow due to its inability to distinguish heat-pulse velocities below a threshold velocity of 0.1 kg h(-1) (3-4 cm h(-1)). The greatest potential for error in the calculation of daily sap flow was associated with the misalignment of temperature sensors, the estimation of sapwood area and the method used to acquire total sap flow from point measurements of sap velocity. A direct comparison of the two heat-pulse methods (applied synchronously) revealed that the HRM had a more convincing mechanism for correcting spacing errors and was more resistant to random fluctuation in measurements than the CHPM. While we view the HRM more favourably than the CHPM in some key areas, both methods are valid and useful, within their constraints, for measuring transpiration in jarrah and other woody species.},

abstract = {This study describes the interaction between Hormathophylla spinosa, a crucifer shrub, and its pollinators, analyzing the spatiotemporal variability of the pollinator assemblage as well as the foraging behavior and effectiveness of the common pollinators. The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective, pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites - mutualism and competition - within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century.

SCOPE: Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun.

CONCLUSIONS: Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

abstract = {Many researchers are using sap flux to estimate tree-level transpiration, and to scale to stand- and catchment-level transpiration; yet studies evaluating the comparability of sap flux-based estimates of transpiration (Et) with alternative methods for estimating Et at this spatial scale are rare. Our ability to accurately scale from the probe to the tree to the watershed has not yet been demonstrated, nor do we know the relative impact of the main sources of variability on our scaled estimates. Accounting for the variability in the radial distribution of sap flux within the sapwood, the variability of transpiration among trees and between plots within the catchment, and the variability in stand density, sapwood area, and leaf area are critical for making landscape inferences about transpiration. During 2004 and 2005, we continuously monitored 40 trees in three plots within a 13.5-ha gauged watershed comprising a 50-year-old eastern white pine plantation within the Coweeta Basin in western North Carolina, USA. We scaled sap flux-based estimates of stand transpiration (Et) and surface area-based estimates of stand interception (Ei) to the catchment and compared these with water balance estimates of evapotranspiration (E, precipitation minus runoff, P - Ro). For both years, the sum of sap flux scaled Et and Ei were 14 and 7{\%} lower than evapotranspiration estimated from P - Ro. Our results show that a considerable amount of variation exists at each scaling step encountered; however, a simple scaling exercise revealed that omitting among plot variation affected the sap flux scaled Et estimate by 48{\%}. Thus, the largest source of variability in scaling to the landscape was landscape variation in stand density and sapwood area. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Nested data structures are ubiquitous in the study of ecology and evolution, and such structures need to be modelled appropriately.Mixed-effectsmodels offer a powerful framework to do so.Nested effects can usually be fitted using the syntax for crossed effects in mixed models, provided that the coding reflects implicit nesting. But the experimental design (either nested or crossed) affects the interpretation of the results. 2. The key difference between nested and crossed effects in mixed models is the estimation and interpretation of the interaction variance. With nested data structures, the interaction variance is pooled with the main effect variance of the nested factor. Crossed designs are required to separate the two components. This difference between nested and crossed data is determined by the experimental design (thus by the nature of data sets) and not by the coding of the statistical model. 3. Data can be nested by design in the sense that it would have been technically feasible and biologically relevant to collect the data in a crossed design. In such cases, the pooling of the variances needs to be clearly acknowledged. In other situations, it might be impractical or even irrelevant to apply a crossed design. We call such situations naturally nested, a case in which the pooling of the interaction variance will be less of an issue. 4. The interpretation of results should reflect the fact that the interaction variance inflates the main effect variance when dealing with nested data structures. Whether or not this distinction is critical depends on the research question and the system under study. 5. We presentmixed models as a particularly useful tool for analysing nested designs, and we highlight the value of the estimated random variance as a quantity of biological interest. Important insights can be gained if random- effect variances are appropriately interpreted. We hope that our paper facilitates the transition from classical ANOVAs tomixed models in dealing with categorical data.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Aging is a complex, multifactorial process resulting in several functional and esthetic changes in the skin. These changes result from intrinsic as well as extrinsic processes, such as ultraviolet radiation. Recent advances in skin biology have increased our understanding of skin homeostasis and the aging process, as well as the mechanisms by which ultraviolet radiation contributes to photoaging and cutaneous disease. These advances in skin biology have led to the development of a diversity of treatments aimed at preventing aging and rejuvenating the skin. The focus of this review is the mechanism of photoaging and the pathophysiology underlying the treatments specifically designed for its prevention and treatment.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES: At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the mechanism of photoaging, the treatments for photoaging, and the data that supports the use of these treatments.},

abstract = {Consumption of green tea polyphenols (GTPs) in drinking water prevents photocarcinogenesis in mice; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully elucidated. Using IL-12p40 knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type counterparts and an established photocarcinogenesis protocol, we found that although administration of GTPs (0.2{\%}, w/v) in drinking water significantly reduced UVB-induced tumor development in wild-type mice, this treatment had a nonsignificant effect in IL-12-KO mice. GTPs resulted in reduction in the levels of markers of inflammation (cyclooxygenase-2, prostaglandin E(2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D1) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) in chronically UVB-exposed skin and skin tumors of wild-type mice but less effective in IL-12p40-KO mice. UVB-induced DNA damage (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) was resolved rapidly in GTPs-treated wild-type mice than untreated wild-type mice and this resolution followed the same time course as the GTPs-induced reduction in the levels of inflammatory responses. This effect of GTPs was less pronounced in IL-12-KO mice. The above results were confirmed by treatment of IL-12-KO mice with murine recombinant IL-12 and treatment of wild-type mice with neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. To our knowledge, it is previously unreported that prevention of photocarcinogenesis by GTPs is mediated through IL-12-dependent DNA repair and a subsequent reduction in skin inflammation.},

Before and after the training sessions, nurses answered questionnaires that measured their confidence levels in providing care for students with epilepsy and seizures; these questionnaires showed an improvement in nurses' confidence levels across all measures. Analysis was also carried out to identify program components and nurse subgroups associated with statistically significant improvements. An evaluation of satisfaction indicated overall satisfaction with the program. This article presents results from 1,080 complete surveys associated with the training in 2007.},

abstract = {Because the flowering and fruiting phenology of plants is sensitive to environmental cues such as temperature and moisture, climate change is likely to alter community-level patterns of reproductive phenology. Here we report a previously unreported phenomenon: experimental warming advanced flowering and fruiting phenology for species that began to flower before the peak of summer heat but delayed reproduction in species that started flowering after the peak temperature in a tallgrass prairie in North America. The warming-induced divergence of flowering and fruiting toward the two ends of the growing season resulted in a gap in the staggered progression of flowering and fruiting in the community during the middle of the season. A double precipitation treatment did not significantly affect flowering and fruiting phenology. Variation among species in the direction and magnitude of their response to warming caused compression and expansion of the reproductive periods of different species, changed the amount of overlap between the reproductive phases, and created possibilities for an altered selective environment to reshape communities in a future warmed world. },

abstract = {Phenological events in Mojave desert systems are triggered by heavy rains ({\textgreater}25 mm [1 in]). The most predictable and consequential of these is a regional rain between late September and early December. This rainfall event is usually the precursor of successful vegetative and reproductive growth of shrubs the next spring, and is usually necessary for all growth phenomena of herbaceous perennials and winter annuals during the following winter and spring. For most plant components in most years, the growing season is synchronized within the autumn-winter-spring period, and the relative biological success each spring is dependent upon the occurrence or failure of occurrence of events of the preceding autumn. Under certain conditions rainfall during other seasons may trigger growth and reproduction of the primary producers and permit at least moderate or local successes every season. The relationships are stated in a flow diagram for the rainfall and phenological events, as documented for 13 yr in the Mojave desert of southern Nevada.},

abstract = {Photoprotection of human skin by means of sunscreens or daily skin-care products is traditionally centered around the prevention of acute (e.g. sunburn) and chronic (e.g. skin cancer and photoaging) skin damage that may result from exposure to ultraviolet rays (UVB and UVA). Within the last decade, however, it has been appreciated that wavelengths beyond the ultraviolet spectrum, in particular visible light and infrared radiation, contribute to skin damage in general and photoaging of human skin in particular. As a consequence, attempts have been made to develop skin care/sunscreen products that not only protect against UVB or UVA radiation but provide photoprotection against visible light and infrared radiation as well. In this article, we will briefly review the current knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for visible light/infrared radiation-induced skin damage and then, based on this information, discuss strategies that have been successfully used or may be employed in the future to achieve photoprotection of human skin beyond ultraviolet radiation. In this regard we will particularly focus on the use of topical antioxidants and the challenges that result from the task of showing their efficacy.},

This paper is focused on the errors in sap flux density (J) caused by probe misalignment and on how to reduce these errors. We found that probe misalignment caused errors in the heat pulse velocity (Vh). Furthermore, probe misalignment had a large influence on thermal diffusivity ($\kappa$) and the determination of zero flow points. Assuming uniform axial thermal diffusivity and zero sap flow conditions, we developed a new in situ probe spacing correction method based on three temperature sensor measurements inside the same temperature probe, which can be used for correcting both linear and nonlinear misalignments. Laboratory experimental results verified that our method could significantly reduce the errors in determinations of J by using the Compensation Heat Pulse velocity (CHP) method, the Heat Ratio (HR) method and the T-max method.},

abstract = {In this paper we use a two-dimensional model of heat and water flow through moist wood to investigate some practical aspects of a variety of heat-pulse methods to measure sap flow. Our analysis includes the 'compensation', 'Tmax', 'heat-ratio' and 'average gradient' methods that typically employ a linear heater probe that is inserted radially into the plant stem. The temperature rise following a brief 1-2 s pulse of heat is monitored for a short period of time (i.e. 60-300 s) using one or two temperature sensors that are located above and/or below the heater probe. The computer model is used to simulate the effect of different sapwood properties, such as the green density and the moisture content, as well as the sap flux densities (cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of water per cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of sapwood cross-section per hour) on the measured heat-pulse velocity. The probe locations were altered to accommodate each of the heat-pulse techniques. Our particular interest here is to investigate the performance of each method over a wide range of sap flows. The 'compensation' and the 'T-max' methods work best at flows {\textgreater}5-10 cm h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} while reverse flows, if they occur, are practically impossible to resolve. Alternative methods such as the 'heat-ratio' and the 'average gradient' method work much better under low and reverse flows yet they have problems resolving even moderate flows above about 40 cm/h using typical averaging periods. The measurement range of the average-gradient method can be extended by using an averaging period of 60 s or less, compared to the current averaging period of 180 s. The performance of the heat-ratio method can not be improved markedly by altering either the probe spacing or the averaging periods. In our opinion the average gradient method is currently the most suitable method to measure the full range sap flows.},

abstract = {Water flux to the atmosphere was measured from a mature stand of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in Saskatchewan, Canada, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Diurnal and seasonal changes in transpiration were monitored using two sap flow techniques and were compared against the difference between eddy correlation measurements of water vapor flux made above and below the aspen canopy. The three methods showed similar diurnal and seasonal trends in water flux, although sap flow lagged the eddy correlation measurements by about 1 hour diurnally due to changes in water storage within the trees. During the growing season, all methods showed a linear increase in midday transpiration with above-canopy vapor pressure deficit (VPD) up to similar to 1 kPa, beyond which transpiration was relatively constant (VPD 1-2.5 kPa). A similar relationship was obtained when total daily transpiration was plotted against mean daytime VPD. The results are consistent with other observations that stomatal conductance of the aspen canopy decreases at high VPD. The complementary benefits of simultaneous monitoring of canopy transpiration by both eddy correlation and sap flow measurements are discussed},

abstract = {Juniperus virginiana (eastern redcedar) is encroaching into mesic prairies of the southern Great Plains, USA, and is altering the hydrologic cycle. We used the thermal dissipation technique to quantify daily water use of J. virginiana into a mesic prairie by measuring 19 trees of different sizes from different density stands located in north-central Oklahoma during 2011. We took the additional step to calibrate our measurements by comparing thermal dissipation technique estimates to volumetric water use for a subset of trees. Except for days with maximum air temperature below −3 °C, J. virginiana trees used water year round, reached a peak in late May, and exhibited reduced water use in summer when soil water availability was low. Overall daily average water use was 24 l (±21.8 l s.d.) per tree. Trees in low density stands used more water than trees with similar diameters from denser stands. However, there was no difference in water use between trees in different density stands when expressed on a canopy area basis. Approximately 50{\%} of variation in water use that remained after accounting for the factors site, tree, and day was explained using a physiologically-based model that included daily potential evapotranspiration, maximum vapour pressure deficit, maximum temperature, solar radiation, and soil water storage between 0 and 10 cm. Our model suggested that a J. virginiana woodland with a closed canopy is capable of transpiring almost all precipitation reaching the soil in years with normal precipitation, indicating the potential for encroachment to reduce water yield for streamflow and groundwater recharge.},

abstract = {Sap flow probes are routinely used in forest and horticulture hydrology for estimating tree water use. This requires unbiased measurements when upscaling from tree to stand level, but accuracy and comparability of different thermometric methods have been questioned. Three sap flow measuring techniques were compared against gravimetric flow measurement in cut stem segments: ‘Granier-type' thermal dissipation probes (TDP; three different sensor types), the heat field deformation method (HFD), and the heat ratio method (HRM). For the empirical methods (TDP and HFD), new calibration parameters were estimated using a nonlinear hierarchical modelling approach. 66 stem segments from five temperate, diffuse-porous tree species (9–16 cm stem diameter, 100 cm stem length) were exposed to a wide range of flux densities by applying subatmospheric pressure (−50 to −650 hPa) analogous to natural flow conditions in the field. All TDP probes underestimated flux density by 23–45{\%} when calculated with Granier's original calibration parameters, with the deviation increasing with flux rate. The accuracy was significantly improved by estimating new calibration parameters, especially for probes differing from Granier's original sensor design. Species-specific parameters further improved accuracy, although the species differences might partially be explained by variation in the observed ranges of sap flux. The HFD sensor overestimated gravimetric flow by ∼11{\%}; empirical calibration did not improve its accuracy compared to the manufacturer's equation. At low to medium flow rates, the HRM system achieved higher accuracy than the other probes (0.8{\%} underestimation), while performing poorly at high flux rates under our measurement settings (energy input of 25 J). Both for TDP and HFD sensors, we observed a surprisingly large variability in calibration parameters between different stems of the same species. We conclude that (i) TDP and HFD sensors require species-specific calibration to measure sap flux with high accuracy, (ii) the original Granier equation cannot be used for TDP probes with deviating design, and (iii), at low to medium flow rates, the highest accuracy can be achieved with HRM sensors. Our results help to increase the accuracy of tree sap flow measurements with thermal dissipation probes, and to assess various levels of errors related to the different thermometric methods. This is important when synthesizing forest transpiration data on regional and global scales.},

abstract = {Many plants are adapted to flower at particular times of year, to ensure optimal pollination and seed maturation. In these plants flowering is controlled by environmental signals that reflect the changing seasons, particularly daylength and temperature. The response to daylength varies, so that plants isolated at higher latitudes tend to flower in response to long daylengths of spring and summer, while plants from lower latitudes avoid the extreme heat of summer by responding to short days. Such responses require a mechanism for measuring time, and the circadian clock that regulates daily rhythms in behaviour also acts as the timer in the measurement of daylength. Plants from high latitudes often also show an extreme response to temperature called vernalisation in which flowering is repressed until the plant is exposed to winter temperatures for an extended time. Genetic approaches in Arabidopsis have identified a number of genes that control vernalisation and daylength responses. These genes are described and models presented for how daylength might regulate flowering by controlling their expression by the circadian clock. BioEssays 22:38-47, 2000.},

Those in the intervention group received a five-session intervention with a nurse trained in MI counseling. Following an in-person introductory session, the remaining four sessions were conducted by phone. Ninety-five percent of the 55 planned MI sessions and the 44 planned courtesy calls for those in the control group were completed, demonstrating high acceptance of the program. Participants were very satisfied with the program and noted the benefits of the telephone delivery method.

abstract = {The Earth's carbon and hydrologic cycles are intimately coupled by gas exchange through plant stomata. However, uncertainties in the magnitude and consequences of the physiological responses of plants to elevated CO2 in natural environments hinders modelling of terrestrial water cycling and carbon storage. Here we use annually resolved long-term $\delta$13C tree-ring measurements across a European forest network to reconstruct the physiologically driven response of intercellular CO2 (Ci) caused by atmospheric CO2 (Ca) trends. When removing meteorological signals from the $\delta$13C measurements, we find that trees across Europe regulated gas exchange so that for one ppmv atmospheric CO2 increase, Ci increased by {\~{}}0.76 ppmv, most consistent with moderate control towards a constant Ci/Ca ratio. This response corresponds to twentieth-century intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) increases of 14 ± 10 and 22 ± 6{\%} at broadleaf and coniferous sites, respectively. An ensemble of process-based global vegetation models shows similar CO2 effects on iWUE trends. Yet, when operating these models with climate drivers reintroduced, despite decreased stomatal opening, 5{\%} increases in European forest transpiration are calculated over the twentieth century. This counterintuitive result arises from lengthened growing seasons, enhanced evaporative demand in a warming climate, and increased leaf area, which together oppose effects of CO2-induced stomatal closure. Our study questions changes to the hydrological cycle, such as reductions in transpiration and air humidity, hypothesized to result from plant responses to anthropogenic emissions.},

abstract = {The foraging behavior of butterflies and bumblebees is compared on the same populations of three Senecio species. While bumblebees typically fly near-neighbor distances, resulting in very localized pollen dispersal, butterflies frequently bypass nearby plants, flying significantly greater distances between plants. Bumblebees visit significantly more heads per plant and significantly more plants per foraging bout. The flight distance distribution data are used to calculate neighborhood size and area, in the sense of Wright's isolation-by-distance model, for the observed populations under hypothetical conditions of exclusive butterfly or exclusive bumblebee pollination. It is predicted that small neighborhood sizes will typically be found in plant populations specializing on bumblebee pollination, whereas butterfly-pollinated populations will have much larger neighborhood sizes; bumblebee-pollinated plants will therefore have greater potential for local genetic differentiation. These differences in neighborhood characteristics may be augmented if plants are self-compatible or if pollen carryover occurs, since bumblebees make a higher proportion of intraplant flights. The addition of a small amount of butterfly pollination can increase gene dispersal in a plant population sufficiently to greatly reduce genetic drift and microgeographic adaptive differentiation.},

Under stationary conditions, the heat energy supplied continuously to a segment of plant stem is partitioned into three components such as conduction, mass flow and convection [see Eq. (1)]. By predetermining both heat losses due to conduction in the stem and convection from the segment surface into ambient air, it is possible to evaluate the heat loss due to mass flow of water in the stem, that is, the water flow rate equivalent to the transpiration stream. The water flow rate evaluated by this method is compared with the transpiration loss of water determined directly by weighing potted soybean and sunflower plants and measured by using a chamber method. The comparison shows there is a good agreement between them. This indicates that the newly developed method can be applied for determining transpiration rates of intact plants under laboratory and field conditions.},

In this meta-analysis, we have systematically reviewed the existing literature on human supplementation studies on dietary protection against sunburn by beta-carotene. A review of literature until June 2007 was performed in PubMed, ISI Web of Science and EBM Cochrane library and identified a total of seven studies which evaluated the effectiveness of beta-carotene in protection against sunburn. Data were abstracted from these studies by means of a standardized data collection protocol. The subsequent meta-analysis showed that (1) beta-carotene supplementation protects against sunburn and (2) the study duration had a significant influence on the effected size. Regression plot analysis revealed that protection required a minimum of 10 weeks of supplementation with a mean increase of the protective effect of 0.5 standard deviations with every additional month of supplementation. Thus, dietary supplementation of humans with beta-carotene provides protection against sunburn in a time-dependent manner.},

Wood-saturated water content, a surrogate for relative water storage capacity, ranged from 70 to 105{\%}, and was inversely related to its morphological correlate, wood density, which ranged between 0.51 and 0.65 g cm(-) (3). Leaf-specific conductivity (k(L)) measured in stem segments from terminal branches ranged from 3 to 18 mmol m(-1) s(-1) MPa-1, and whole-plant hydraulic efficiency calculated as stomatal conductance (g) divided by the difference between predawn and midday leaf water potential (Psi(L)), ranged from 70 to 150 mmol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1. Hydraulic efficiency was positively correlated with k(L) (r(2) = 0.86). Minimum annual Psi(L) ranged from - 1.5 to - 4.1 MPa among the six species. Seasonal and diurnal variation in Psi(L) were associated with differences among species in wood-saturated water content, wood density and k(L). The species with higher wood-saturated water content were more efficient in terms of long-distance water transport, exhibited smaller diurnal variation in Psi(L) and higher maximum photosynthetic rates. Smaller diurnal variation in Psi(L) in species with higher wood-saturated water content, k(L) and hydraulic efficiency was not associated with stomatal restriction of transpiration when soil water deficit was moderate, but avoidance of low minimum seasonal Psi(L) in these species was associated with a substantial seasonal decline in g. Low seasonal minimum Psi(L) in species with low k(L), hydraulic efficiency, and wood-saturated water content was associated with higher leaf solute content and corresponding lower leaf turgor loss point. Despite the species-specific differences in leaf water relations characteristics, all six evergreen tree species shared a common functional relationship defined primarily by k(L) and stem water storage capacity.},

The HRM has several important advantages over the CHPM, including improved measurement range and resolution, protocols to correct for physical and thermal errors in sensor deployment, and a simple linear function to describe wound effects.

abstract = {Sap flow along the long distance water transport system in plants is essential in maintaining the hydraulic connection between the soil and the atmosphere. Studying the movement and dynamics of sap throughout a plant is hence key to progress our scientific knowledge about plant hydraulic function or dys-function and growth in a given environment. At the Ninth International Workshop on Sap Flow, held in Ghent, Belgium, from 4 to 7 June 2013, over 160 partici-pants coming from 30 different countries discussed the cur-rent understanding of plant hydraulics and the significance of studies of sap flow in furthering our knowledge of plant water use and function under varying environmental conditions. These discussions dealt not only with measurement method-ology, but focused largely on new insights into plant hydraulic function with a session specifically addressing cavitation as a limiting factor in the hydraulic pathway. Additionally, the importance and applicability of water transport modelling to deepen our understanding of plant hydraulics were consid-ered and the use of sap flow for some practical applications was presented. From these sessions, 10 authors contributed research papers based on their talks for this special issue of Tree Physiology (Baert et al. 2015, Carrasco et al. 2015, Torres-Ruiz et al. 2015, Vandegehuchte et al. 2015, Vergeynst et al. 2015, Zeppel et al. 2014, Eller et al. 2015, Liesche et al. 2015, Paudel et al. 2015, Windt and Bl{\"{u}}mler 2015).},

@article{Shimizu2015,
abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated from a planted coniferous forest in southwestern Japan by applying three methods: the eddy covariance method; the measurement of rainfall (P) and runoff (Q) in a small watershed; and a combination of rainfall interception loss (IC), upper canopy transpiration based on a sap-flux density measurement in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria Japonica D. Don) stands (EUC), and modeled sub-canopy ET (ESC). After inverse multiplication of the energy imbalance ratio, ET by the eddy covariance method (ETEC) was 839.9mm in 2007 and 811.8mm in 2008. The yearly values of P-Q were partially affected by P in the previous autumn. After continuous data collection for more than 5years, P-Q became stable. The 9-year (2000-2008) average P-Q, which was considered most reliable in this study, was 897.5mmy-1. The cumulative ETECduring the daylight hours from the right stream bank, covered mainly with large Japanese cedars, was 894.1mm from April 2007 to March 2008. The value was almost the same as that calculated as the components sum (ETCOMP=IC+EUC+ESC: 911.4mm), and the comparison suggested that the annual totals of ETECwith an energy imbalance correction provide a reliable estimate of ET in a forest stand on a complex topography. Spatial variation in the watershed was likely caused by differences in soil water retention at each slope position. The slight difference in annual ETECin 2007 compared with 2008 was attributed to differences in the radiative energy input. In the monthly-weekly analysis, ETCOMPwas frequently higher than ETECafter heavy rainfall, while ETECwas higher under dry conditions and during active ET. Even under dry canopy conditions, daily ETECwas often higher than EUC+ESC. The results suggested a time-lag in evaporation from the ecosystem and/or under-estimated ETECafter rainfall.},

abstract = {Responses of flower-visiting animals to floral density can alter interactions between plants, influencing a variety of biological processes, including plant population dynamics and the evolution of flowering phenology. Many studies have found effects of floral or plant density on pollinator visitation rates at patch scales, but little is known about responses of flower visitors to floral densities at larger scales. Here, I present data from an observational field study in which I measured the effects of floral density on visitation to the annual composite Holocarpha virgata at both patch (4 m(2)) and site (12.6 ha) spatial scales. The species composition of flower visitors changed with floral density, and did so in different ways at the two scales. At the site scale, average floral density within patches of H. virgata or within patches of all summer-flowering species combined had a significant positive effect on per-flowerhead visitation by the long-horned bee Melissodes lupina and no significant effects on visitation by any other taxa. At the patch scale, per-flowerhead visitation by honeybees significantly increased whereas visitation by M. lupina often decreased with increasing floral density. For both species, responses to patch-scale floral density were strongest when site-scale floral density was high. The scale-dependence of flower visitor responses to floral density and the interactions between site- and patch-scale effects of floral density observed in this study underscore the importance of improving our understanding of pollinators' responses to floral density at population scales.},

abstract = {Stimulation of C3 crop yield by rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]) is widely expected to counteract crop losses that are due to greater drought this century. But these expectations come from sparse field trials that have been biased towards mesic growth conditions. This eight-year study used precipitation manipulation and year- to-year variation in weather conditions at a unique open-air field facility to show that the stimulation of soybean yield by elevated [CO2] diminished to zero as drought intensified. Contrary to the prevalent expectation in the literature, rising [CO2] did not counteract the effect of strong drought on photosynthesis and yield because elevated [CO2] interacted with drought to modify stomatal function and canopy energy balance. This new insight from field experimentation under hot and dry conditions, which will become increasingly prevalent in the coming decades, highlights the likelihood of negative impacts from interacting global change factors on a key global commodity crop in its primary region of production.},

A tree(s) is (are) cultured in a container, a pot, etc. to limit soil volume and control easily water and nutrient condition. This system has ability to get high quality products but needs an irrigation system. To irrigate exactly, estimating water use is a first step for this application. To evaluate a technique that estimates simply the long-term water use in Japanese pear, results from the Granier sap flow method were compared with the transpiration using a balance. The sap flow rate was calculated by multiplying the sap flux density given in Granier's original equation by the sapwood area estimated using a dyeing method. The hourly sap flow rate as measured by the Granier method was in good agreement with the hourly transpiration rate through a month, for the range of low fluxes considered: up to about 0.6 L h-1. Furthermore, the daily sap flow rate was in good agreement with the daily transpiration rate during the growing period. These results suggest that the Granier method can be used directly to measure the hourly or daily transpiration rate in Japanese pear under low transpiration condition and estimate water use for irrigation scheduling purposes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Self-management majorly determines the health status of patients with epilepsy because the most important strategies for controlling seizures include receiving and adhering to prescribed therapies, and making appropriate lifestyle adjustments. Patients with epilepsy have various educational needs and must adopt many self-management behaviors to control their condition. This study was a clinical trial that evaluated the effects of an educational program on self-management in patients with epilepsy.

METHODS: Participants (n=60) were recruited from the Neurology Clinic in Zanjan, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups (n=30 in each). The intervention group received four educational sessions on epilepsy, including a self-management plan. All participants completed the Epilepsy Self-Management Scale before the intervention and 1 month post-intervention. The chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, and paired samples t-test were used to compare the groups.

RESULTS: At baseline, demographic characteristics and self-management scores did not differ significantly. One month after the intervention, self-management scores differed significantly (p{\textless}0.001) between the two groups.

CONCLUSION: The educational program had beneficial effects on self-management behaviors in patients with epilepsy.},

Here we show for the first time that scent advertisement is higher in plant species that bloom early in the flowering period when pollinators are scarce relative to flowers than in species blooming later in the season when there is a surplus of pollinators relative to flowers. We also show that less abundant flowering species that may compete with dominant species for pollinator visitation early in the flowering period emit much higher proportions of the generalist attractant $\beta$-ocimene. Overall, we provide a first community-wide description of the key role of seasonal dynamics of plant-specific flower scent emissions, and reveal the coexistence of contrasting plant signaling strategies in a plant-pollinator market.},

abstract = {Sustainable management of water resources allocated to palm crops requires reliable tools for measuring palm water use. Thermometric sap flow methods developed for woody dicot plants hold great potential for use in palms, but there have been few investigations to determine whether such methods can be used successfully in 'woody' monocots. Here, we evaluate two sap flow methods for measuring whole-plant water use by potted cocos palms (Syagrus romanzoffiana): the Heat Ratio Method (HRM) and the Compensation Heat Pulse Method (CHPM). Measurements of whole-plant water use from the HRM and the CHPM were compared to gravimetric measurements acquired from an electronic balance. Of the two methods, the HRM gave the most accurate results and it most precisely described patterns of transpiration with respect to environmental conditions and leaf morphology. Estimates of total daily water use from the HRM and the balance were highly correlated (R2 = 0.92; P {\textless} 0.0001) and very near to a 1:1 relationship-an excellent result given the potential for error associated with each method. As expected, the CHPM was seriously limited at low flow rates, but it agreed well with the HRM at higher flow rates (heat pulse velocity {\textgreater}4 cm h-1). Anatomical investigations revealed that vascular bundles in measured palm fronds were evenly distributed and the distance between bundles was comparable in scale to the diameter of probes of HRM sensors, and most likely an order of magnitude smaller than the probable zone of thermal influence for HRM measurements. This contention was supported by results of mathematical modeling suggesting that HRM heat pulse velocities in palm-like sapwood remain largely unaffected by increases in heterogeneity caused by larger xylem vessels and wider interstitial tissues. Although wounding models for heat pulse sap flow methods have not historically catered for the effects of discrete vascular bundles, they are sufficiently approximate given our empirical validations, and we conclude that palm sapwood is thermally homogenous enough for the HRM and the CHPM to be used without modification. Overall, we present strong evidence that heat pulse methods such as the HRM and the CHPM can be used successfully in woody monocots. Finally, we note that the CHPM is likely to perform better in cases of very high flow rates, while the HRM provides more comprehensive monitoring of the usual range of flow rates including at night, early morning and during water deficit. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Melatonin has attracted attention because of their high antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activity. Otherwise, the use of sunscreens is recommended for patients after chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments or to prevent UV radiation-induced skin damages that may result in pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the beneficial influence of melatonin in topical sunscreen emulsions combined with three common ultraviolet filters. METHODS: After the formulation characterization in terms of rheology, stability studies were performed. Release studies let us to evaluate its mechanism of delivery and ex vivo permeation study through human skin, the amount of melatonin retained. The antioxidant activity assay was also carried out, and finally the in vivo photoprotective effect in rats was tested as transepidermal water loss and erythema formation. RESULTS: The rheological behaviour of formulations was pseudoplastic fluid, all emulsions had good physical stability. Release studies showed a trend of enhancement in melatonin release from emulsions incorporating UV filters and followed a Weibull model. Melatonin permeation was higher from the emulsion containing melatonin combined with a mixture of three ultraviolet filters (MMIX) formulation. Equally this formulation exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity. Finally the photoprotective assay showed that only skin areas treated with this formulation were statistically equivalent to the unirradiated control area. CONCLUSION: MMIX formulation would be a promising formulation for preventing the undesirable adverse effects of UV skin irradiation because melatonin not only acts as a potent antioxidant itself, but also is capable of activating an endogenous enzymatic protective system against oxidative stress.},

abstract = {Photo-induced damage to proteins occurs via multiple pathways. Direct damage induced by UVB ($\lambda$ 280-320 nm) and UVA radiation ($\lambda$ 320-400 nm) is limited to a small number of amino acid residues, principally tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), histidine (His) and disulfide (cystine) residues, with this occurring via both excited state species and radicals. Indirect protein damage can occur via singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)(1)$\Delta$(g)), with this resulting in damage to Trp, Tyr, His, cystine, cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met) residues. Although initial damage is limited to these residues multiple secondary processes, that occur both during and after radiation exposure, can result in damage to other intra- and inter-molecular sites. Secondary damage can arise via radicals (e.g. Trp, Tyr and Cys radicals), from reactive intermediates generated by (1)O(2) (e.g. Trp, Tyr and His peroxides) and via molecular reactions of photo-products (e.g. reactive carbonyls). These processes can result in protein fragmentation, aggregation, altered physical and chemical properties (e.g. hydrophobicity and charge) and modulated biological turnover. Accumulating evidence implicates these events in cellular and tissue dysfunction (e.g. apoptosis, necrosis and altered cell signaling), and multiple human pathologies.},

abstract = {1. Variations in water tension in a transpiring tree cause elastic changes in stem diameter. To better understand the dynamics of these variations, stem diameter changes and sap flow rates were monitored simultaneously in trees from two Scots pine chronosequences in Scotland. 2. Tree below-ground hydraulic conductance (k(bg)) was estimated from the relationship between leaf-specific sap flow rates and the difference between stem and soil water potentials estimated from diameter variations in the stem. 3. In a given tree, k(bg) varied both within and among days, with conductance increasing as a function of sap flow and evaporative demand. These patterns could be explained in terms of a composite model of root water transport and possible changes in the gating of aquaporins. 4. We interpreted these trends of increasing k(bg) with evaporative demand as a mechanism to enhance the ability of trees to control leaf water potential and keep it within physiologically acceptable limits, with potential implications for our general understanding of plant water relations, and for the estimation and modelling of ecosystem water fluxes. 5. Across trees, k(bg) declined with increasing tree age/size, but the proportional contribution of below-ground to whole-tree hydraulic resistance also declined. This is consistent with an increase in below-ground carbon allocation in old/tall trees and a partial acclimation of tall trees to hydraulic limitations. It is argued that these trends have to be considered when discussing the importance of tree height for water transport and growth.},

abstract = {The use of a heat-pulse technique to monitor sap flow from which transpiration can be deduced was evaluated in ungrafted grapevines (Vitis vinifera L., cv. Sultana) under glasshouse and field conditions. There was a significant degree of agreement between daily transpiration deduced from heat-pulse velocity (T-hp) and that determined directly by gravimetry in the glasshouse and by calibration using the Penman-Monteith equation in the field. Comparison throughout the growing season of T-hp to transpiration calculated with the full Penman-Monteith equation produced a high coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.69). A similar comparison of T-hp with transpiration calculated with only the aerodynamic component of the Penman-Monteith equation produced a non-linear relationship, due to the equation over-estimating transpiration relative to T-hp at high vapour pressure deficits (i.e. Above 2.5 kPa). Values for total seasonal transpiration measured with heat-pulse sensors or calculated with either the full Penman-Monteith equation or with only the modified aerodynamic component of the equation were within 10{\%} of each other. Transpiration (T-hp) in grapevines with an adequate supply of soil water was shown to be coupled to ambient air conditions.},

Recent advances indicate that FT transcriptional regulation is central for integrating the information derived from other important internal and external factors, such as developmental age, amount of gibberellic acid, and the ambient temperature.

abstract = {Differences among plant species in visitation rate and seed set within a community may be explained both by the species' floral traits and the community context. Additionally, the importance of species' floral traits vs. community context on visitation rate and seed set may vary among communities. In communities where the pollinator-to-flower ratio is low, floral traits may be more important than community context, as pollinators may have the opportunity to be choosier when visiting plant species. In this study we investigated whether species' floral traits (flower shape, size and number, and flowering duration) and community context (conspecific and heterospecific flower density, and pollinator abundance) could explain among-species variation in visitation rate and seed set. For this, we used data on 47 plant species from two Norwegian plant communities differing in pollinator-to-flower ratio. Differences among species in visitation rate and seed set within a community could be explained by similar variables as those explaining visitation rate and seed set within species. As expected, we found floral traits to be more important than community context in the community with a lower pollinator-to-flower ratio; whereas in the community with a higher pollinator-to-flower ratio, community context played a bigger role. Our study gives significant insights into the relative importance of floral traits on species' visitation rate and seed set, and contributes to our understanding of the role of the community context on the fitness of plant species.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine, in a sample of older adults diagnosed with epilepsy, perceived self-management problems and needs encountered since diagnosis, as well as strategies used to address problems and needs.

METHODS: Qualitative description was used. Twenty older adults engaged in face-to-face interviews. Interviews were analyzed via content analysis.

RESULTS: Participants reported problems, needs, and strategies in six categories: Information, Physical and Emotional Symptoms, Memory and Concentration, Medications, Commitments, and Relationships.

CONCLUSION: Participants noted some problems and needs previously documented in the literature, though current results have built upon extant literature to reveal etiologies of and contexts surrounding problems and needs; new findings were also revealed. This knowledge can be used by health-care providers in counseling and educating older adults with epilepsy and can inform formal self-management interventions.

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Determining needs from the patient's perspective is consistent with today's focus on patient-centered care. Current findings have led to an organizing framework for problems and needs of older adults with epilepsy. More research is needed to develop the framework so that it can serve as a template for an intervention. In the interim, findings can inform educational practices of those caring for this population.},

abstract = {Skin is the largest body organ that serves as an important environmental interface providing a protective envelope that is crucial for homeostasis. On the other hand, the skin is a major target for toxic insult by a broad spectrum of physical (i.e. UV radiation) and chemical (xenobiotic) agents that are capable of altering its structure and function. Many environmental pollutants are either themselves oxidants or catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly or indirectly. ROS are believed to activate proliferative and cell survival signaling that can alter apoptotic pathways that may be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of skin disorders including photosensitivity diseases and some types of cutaneous malignancy. ROS act largely by driving several important molecular pathways that play important roles in diverse pathologic processes including ischemia-reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory responses. The skin possesses an array of defense mechanisms that interact with toxicants to obviate their deleterious effect. These include non-enzymatic and enzymatic molecules that function as potent antioxidants or oxidant-degrading systems. Unfortunately, these homeostatic defenses, although highly effective, have limited capacity and can be overwhelmed thereby leading to increased ROS in the skin that can foster the development of dermatological diseases. One approach to preventing or treating these ROS-mediated disorders is based on the administration of various antioxidants in an effort to restore homeostasis. Although many antioxidants have shown substantive efficacy in cell culture systems and in animal models of oxidant injury, unequivocal confirmation of their beneficial effects in human populations has proven elusive.},

Ten species (3{\%}) flowered significantly later in the 1990s than previously. These data reveal the strongest biological signal yet of climatic change. Flowering is especially sensitive to the temperature in the previous month, and spring-flowering species are most responsive. However, large interspecific differences in this response will affect both the structure of plant communities and gene flow between species as climate warms. Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones.},

abstract = {Abstract. The heat pulse method for determining sap flux in large woody sterns was modified for easier field operation. It uses the measurement of the time elapsed between heat pulse release by a line heater radially inserted in the stem, and the occurrence of maximum temperature 15 mm downstream of the heater. This spacing between heater and thermometer is critical to the reliability of the measurement. Calculations using uncorrected theory provide estimates of the sap flux density in stems with both uniform and non-uniform cross-sectional distribution of conducting tissues which are about 55{\%} of the actual sap flux density. This factor results from insufficient thermal homogeneity between tissues where sap flow occurs and tissues where sap flow has been interrupted. Sap flow in trunks of citrus trees was inferred from measurements of the cross-sectional distribution of sap flux density. Variability of sap flux density is specific to each trunk and is time-dependent and imposes multiple radial and angular measurements. The method was checked in a citrus trunk ramified into three branches. Instantaneous determinations of the flow in the trunk and in the branches differed by less than 5.7{\%}. The daily values agreed within 2.8{\%}.},

On average, date of maximum flowering advanced 2.4 days °C(-1), although species-specific responses varied from - 13.5 to + 7.3 days °C(-1). Plant functional types exhibited distinct patterns of phenological responsiveness with significant differences between native and introduced species, among flowering seasons, and between wind- and biotically pollinated species. This study is the first to assess large-scale patterns of phenological responsiveness with broad species representation and is an important step towards understanding current and future impacts of climate change on species performance and biodiversity.},

abstract = {The pollination syndrome hypothesis has provided a major conceptual framework for how plants and pollinators interact. However, the assumption of specialization in pollination systems and the reliability of floral traits in predicting the main pollinators have been questioned recently. In addition, the relationship between ecological and evolutionary specialization in pollination interactions is still poorly understood. We used data of 62 plant species from three communities across southern Norway to test: (1) the relationships between floral traits and the identity of pollinators, (2) the association between floral traits (evolutionary specialization) and ecological generalization, and (3) the consistency of both relationships across communities. Floral traits significantly affected the identity of pollinators in the three communities in a way consistent with the predictions derived from the pollination syndrome concept. However, hover flies and butterflies visited flowers with different shapes in different communities, which we mainly attribute to among-community variation in pollinator assemblages. Interestingly, ecological generalization depended more on the community-context (i.e. the plant and pollinator assemblages in the communities) than on specific floral traits. While open yellow and white flowers were the most generalist in two communities, they were the most specialist in the alpine community. Our results warn against the use of single measures of ecological generalization to question the pollination syndrome concept, and highlight the importance of community comparisons to assess the pollination syndromes, and to understand the relationships between ecological and evolutionary specialization in plant-pollinator interactions.},

The Granier system measured up to 50{\%} lower sapflow than the Cermak system at high flow rates. New coefficients for the Granier system were estimated, based on sapflow density from the Cermak measurements. Without compensation, natural temperature gradients may cause large errors in measurements made by the Granier system. By using a horizontal reference sensor, no compensation was necessary. It was also shown that radial flow patterns must be considered when calculating total tree sapflow. Transpiration of two adjacent stands, one measured by the Granier method and the other by the Cermak method, showed good agreement internally and with total evaporation measured by the eddy-correlation method.},

abstract = {Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs – determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40{\%} of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75{\%} of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

abstract = {In semi-arid ecosystems, evapotranspiration (Et) generally represents the greatest flux of water out of an ecosystem and is sensitive to changes in vegetation cover. In southern Australia, removal of native, deep-rooted perennials to make way for annual crops and pastures with shallower roots and less annual transpiration has led to rising, saline groundwater. Steps to redress this hydrological imbalance require knowledge of the ecohydrology of native systems such as eucalypt woodlands, which grow on deeper soils low in the landscape, and, unlike annual crops, sustain growth and water use during summer months. We assessed the partitioning of Et in a common woodland type in south-western Australia (Eucalyptus capillosa subsp. capillosa Brooker and Hopper) and the response of tree transpiration (Esap) to both atmospheric and soil water conditions. Overall, the total woodland evapotranspiration (Etotal) exceeded present-year rainfall (359 mm vs. 265 mm) but was equal to average rainfall of the preceding 10 years, suggesting long-term balance in water supply and Etotal in this system. The contribution of Esap to Etotal was surprisingly small (53 and 22{\%} of Etotal in summer and winter, respectively) while woodland floor evapotranspiration (Efloor) contributed 38 and 64{\%} during the same periods. Rates of Esap increased in response to summer rainfall, due primarily to reduced sensitivity in summer to vapour pressure deficit when soil water potentials increased. Additionally, night-time tree transpiration contributed appreciably to the overall water budget (2-8{\%} of seasonal Etotal), being similar in magnitude to interception losses, and therefore should be included in water budgets. Partitioning of Etotal in this woodland type also demonstrated that trees provide a more stable water flux out of the system than Efloor, most likely because they access soil water from a large volume of soil. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory studies have implicated solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation as a tumor initiator, tumor promoter and complete carcinogen, and their excessive exposure can lead to the development of various skin disorders including melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Sunscreens are useful, but their protection is not adequate to prevent the risk of UV-induced skin cancer. It may be because of inadequate use, incomplete spectral protection and toxicity. Therefore new chemopreventive methods are necessary to protect the skin from photodamaging effects of solar UV radiation. Chemoprevention refers to the use of agents that can inhibit, reverse or retard the process of skin carcinogenesis. In recent years, considerable interest has been focused on identifying naturally occurring botanicals, specifically dietary, for the prevention of photocarcinogenesis. A wide variety of botanicals, mostly dietary flavonoids or phenolic substances, have been reported to possess substantial anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities because of their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. This review summarizes chemopreventive effects of some selected botanicals, such as apigenin, curcumin, grape seed proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, silymarin, and green tea polyphenols, against photocarcinogenesis in in vitro and in vivo systems. Attention has also been focused on highlighting the mechanism of chemopreventive action of these dietary botanicals. We suggest that in addition to the use of these botanicals as dietary supplements for the protection of photocarcinogenesis, these botanicals may favorably supplement sunscreens protection and may provide additional antiphotocarcinogenic protection including the protection against other skin disorders caused by solar UV radiation.},

abstract = {This paper reports on modelling to predict airborne olive pollen season severity, expressed as a pollen index (PI), in C{\'{o}}rdoba province (southern Spain) several weeks prior to the pollen season start. Using a 29-year database (1982-2010), a multivariate regression model based on five indices-the index-based model-was built to enhance the efficacy of prediction models. Four of the indices used were biometeorological indices: thermal index, pre-flowering hydric index, dormancy hydric index and summer index; the fifth was an autoregressive cyclicity index based on pollen data from previous years. The extreme weather events characteristic of the Mediterranean climate were also taken into account by applying different adjustment criteria. The results obtained with this model were compared with those yielded by a traditional meteorological-based model built using multivariate regression analysis of simple meteorological-related variables. The performance of the models (confidence intervals, significance levels and standard errors) was compared, and they were also validated using the bootstrap method. The index-based model built on biometeorological and cyclicity indices was found to perform better for olive pollen forecasting purposes than the traditional meteorological-based model.},

abstract = {Soil and plant hydraulics constrain ecosystem productivity by setting physical limits to water transport and hence carbon uptake by leaves. While more negative xylem water potentials provide a larger driving force for water transport, they also cause cavitation that limits hydraulic conductivity. An optimum balance between driving force and cavitation occurs at intermediate water potentials, thus defining the maximum transpiration rate the xylem can sustain (denoted as E(max)). The presence of this maximum raises the question as to whether plants regulate transpiration through stomata to function near E(max). To address this question, we calculated E(max) across plant functional types and climates using a hydraulic model and a global database of plant hydraulic traits. The predicted E(max) compared well with measured peak transpiration across plant sizes and growth conditions (R = 0.86, P {\textless} 0.001) and was relatively conserved among plant types (for a given plant size), while increasing across climates following the atmospheric evaporative demand. The fact that E(max) was roughly conserved across plant types and scales with the product of xylem saturated conductivity and water potential at 50{\%} cavitation was used here to explain the safety-efficiency trade-off in plant xylem. Stomatal conductance allows maximum transpiration rates despite partial cavitation in the xylem thereby suggesting coordination between stomatal regulation and xylem hydraulic characteristics.},

abstract = {Differences in floral traits among plant species have often been attributed to adaptation to pollinators. We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining floral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying floral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and flower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and floral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically fit the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are significantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and flower color did not show any consistently significant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors.},

abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92{\%} of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25{\%} of traits) and/or ACDC (40{\%}) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

In the absence of topically added compounds, skin protection depends solely on endogenous defense. Micronutrients can act as UV absorbers, as antioxidants, or can modulate signaling pathways elicited upon UV exposure. UV-induced erythema is a suitable parameter to assess photoprotection. Dietary protection is provided by carotenoids, tocopherols, ascorbate, flavonoids, or n-3 fatty acids, contributing to maintenance resistance as part of lifelong protection.},

Mutualistic interactions may be especially vulnerable because of the potential for phenological mismatching if the species involved do not respond similarly to changes in temperature. Here we present an analysis of climate-associated shifts in the phenology of wild bees, the most important pollinators worldwide, and compare these shifts to published studies of bee-pollinated plants over the same time period. We report that over the past 130 y, the phenology of 10 bee species from northeastern North America has advanced by a mean of 10.4 ± 1.3 d. Most of this advance has taken place since 1970, paralleling global temperature increases. When the best available data are used to estimate analogous rates of advance for plants, these rates are not distinguishable from those of bees, suggesting that bee emergence is keeping pace with shifts in host-plant flowering, at least among the generalist species that we investigated. },

But they rarely can locate that information because it is buried in the scientific literature, usually in a format that is inaccessible to text search engines. We have developed a public knowledgebase that enables data-driven access to the collection of peer-reviewed publications in molecular evolution and phylogenetics that have reported estimates of time of divergence between species. Users can query the TimeTree resource by providing two names of organisms (common or scientific) that can correspond to species or groups of species. The current TimeTree web resource (TimeTree2) contains timetrees reported from molecular clock analyses in 910 published studies and 17 341 species that span the diversity of life. TimeTree2 interprets complex and hierarchical data from these studies for each user query, which can be launched using an iPhone application, in addition to the website. Published time estimates are now readily accessible to the scientific community, K-12 and college educators, and the general public, without requiring knowledge of evolutionary nomenclature.

AVAILABILITY: TimeTree2 is accessible from the URL http://www.timetree.org, with an iPhone app available from iTunes (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timetree/id372842500?mt=8) and a YouTube tutorial (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxmshZQciwo).},

Several methods are available to measure water use by plants, and among them, sap flow estimation techniques are currently popular, although the interpretation of data may be complex due to several assumptions. In this study, we present a combined approach to measure transpiration rates in mature, field-grown dwarf apple trees ('Empire'/M.9) in a humid climate. Sap flow gauges (heat pulse method) were used to estimate sap flow rates on apples, over a period of 10 weeks. The gauges were first calibrated with simultaneous measurements of whole-canopy gas exchange using chambers mounted on the same plants for short periods (5 days). Mid-summer transpiration rates were peaked at about 2.5 l day-1 m-2 of leaf area but generally averaged about 2 l day-1 m-2 of leaf area. Calculated basal crop coefficients were generally lower than those reported in literature, variable and were a function of the vapor pressure deficit, thus confirming the concerns of using crop coefficients with reference grass in humid climates especially when applied to tall, discontinuous canopies that are well coupled with the bulk air. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Granier sap flow method is a simple and easily applicable method to monitor sap flow in trees in field conditions, and is thus in wide use. However, it has been suggested that the method is slow to capture transient changes in actual sap flux density due to heat storage and release within the stem. We show here how this may lead to biases in the estimation of the dynamics of sap flux density especially at low flow rates when thermal diffusivity is low. We also demonstrate how the traditional Granier sap flow method could be modified to improve the temporal precision of the sap flow measurement. In the new system, the temperature difference between the heated and the reference needle is kept constant by varying the heating power and the sap flux density is calculated from the power consumption. This leads to reduced changes in the heat content of stem. These modifications also make the method more robust in terms of stability of power supply and reduce power consumption during low flow conditions. The time dynamics of the Granier method and the new "steady temperature method" are simulated with a previously published numerical model of xylem heat balance and tested in a laboratory experiment with cut pieces of stem. The numerical model is also used to demonstrate that the relation between parameter K, calculated from instantaneous sensor temperature and maximum sensor temperature, and actual sap flux density is not constant for either the traditional Granier or the new modified sensor, but is dependent on the range of sapflow rates examined and on the value of thermal diffusivity. Continuous measurements of thermal diffusivity of the sapwood along with the needle temperature/power consumption could help to improve the accuracy of the sap flow measurements.},

@article{Petanidou2014,
abstract = {Abstract Recent anthropogenic climate change is strongly associated with average shifts toward earlier seasonal timing of activity (phenology) in temperate-zone species. Shifts in phenology have the potential to alter ecological interactions, to the detriment of one or more interacting species. Recent models predict that detrimental phenological mismatch may increasingly occur between plants and their pollinators. One way to test this prediction is to examine data from ecological communities that experience large annual weather fluctuations. Taking this approach, we analyzed interactions over a four-year period among 132 plant species and 665 pollinating insect species within a Mediterranean community. For each plant species we recorded onset and duration of flowering and number of pollinator species. Flowering onset varied among years, and a year of earlier flowering of a species tended to be a year of fewer species pollinating its flowers. This relationship was attributable principally to early-flowering species, suggesting that shifts toward earlier phenology driven by climate change may reduce pollination services due to phenological mismatch. Earlier flowering onset of a species also was associated with prolonged flowering duration, but it is not certain that this will counterbalance any negative effects of lower pollinator species richness on plant reproductive success. Among plants with different life histories, annuals were more severely affected by flowering–pollinator mismatches than perennials. Specialized plant species (those attracting a smaller number of pollinator species) did not experience disproportionate interannual fluctuations in phenology. Thus they do not appear to be faced with disproportionate fluctuations in pollinator species richness, contrary to the expectation that specialists are at greatest risk of losing mutualistic interactions because of climate change.},

T as a proportion of ET is highest in tropical rainforests (70±14{\%}) and lowest in steppes, shrublands and deserts (51±15{\%}), but there is no relationship of T/ET versus P across all available data (R2=0.01). Changes to transpiration due to increasing CO2 concentrations, land use changes, shifting ecozones and climate warming are expected to have significant impacts upon runoff and groundwater recharge. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The thermal dissipation technique (TD) has become one of the most popular methods for sap flow measurements. As other methods, the TD technique implies a damage of the wood tissue, consequently changing wood thermal properties due to healing reactions. Several studies report an underestimation of sap flow due to the wound effects and specific corrections have been developed for the individual methods. However, the wound effect has not yet been experimentally assessed for the TD method. In this paper we suggest an empirical approach to investigate the effect of wound healing on measured sap flux densities with TD probes. Our main goal is to establish specific correction factors for both ring-porous and diffuse-porous species, according to the duration of installation. Successive sets of TD probes will be installed in early- as well as in mid-growing season in diffuse- and ring-porous trees (Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea) in order to test the effects of dynamic wound formation. The trees will be cut in autumn and additional sets of sensors will be installed in each stem segment, thus without wound reaction. Different flux densities will be applied through the segments in the laboratory and be measured gravimetrically and by the TD sensors simultaneously. Gravimetric flow can then be compared to the TD sensors with and without wound reactions. Production of thick-walled xylem may disturb the flow path and heat conductivity around the inserted aluminium tubes of the TD probes. Therefore, we hypothesize a stronger underestimation of sap flow with increasing time since installation. A higher wound effect is also expected in ring-porous species and in warmer and wetter conditions. Wound correction factors obtained in this study could be implemented to any other TD measurements in the same species in order to improve the accuracy of the estimations of tree water use.},

@article{Damiani2006,
abstract = {Owing to the spectral distribution of solar UV, the UVA component of sunlight is now believed to be the main cause of photoaging and photocarcinogenesis and is much more effective than UVB in inducing peroxidative damage. Consequently, most skin care cosmetic products now include UVA filters in their formulations along with UVB filters. These modern sunscreens should provide and maintain their initial absorbance, hence protection, throughout the entire period of exposure to sunlight. However, not all UVA and UVB filters are sufficiently photostable. In this study, we examine the correlation between the photochemical degradation of sunscreen agents under UVA irradiation, with particular reference to the UVA-absorber 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane, alone and in combination with other organic UV filters (2-ethylhexyl 4 methoxycinnamate and 2-ethylhexyl 2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate) and their ability to prevent UVA-induced lipid peroxidation. Since antioxidants are also added to formulations to deactivate free radicals generated during UVA exposure, vitamin E and the synthetic antioxidant, bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-oxyl-piperidine-4-yl)sebacate, a nitroxide derivative, were also included in this study. By using simple in vitro tests, the results show that a decrease in spectral absorbance of the UV filters correlates in most cases with increased UVA-induced lipid peroxidation; this depends on the specific UV absorber analysed and also on whether they are alone or in combination. Furthermore, the combined presence or absence of antioxidants has a profound effect on this oxidative event. In particular, the nitroxide appears to be a more efficient photo-antioxidant than vitamin E. Similar experiments were also performed under natural sunlight and the results obtained did not differ substantially from those performed under UVA. The results presented and discussed in this work may help in understanding the effects of UVA/UVB absorbers and antioxidants upon the level of UV-induced ROS generated under UVA exposure and in natural sunlight which could be relevant for improving the photoprotection and efficacy of skin care cosmetic formulations.},

abstract = {Climate change has led to phenological shifts in flowering plants and insect pollinators, causing concern that these shifts will disrupt plant-pollinator mutualisms. We experimentally investigated how shifts in flowering onset affect pollinator visitation for 14 native perennial plant species, six of which have exhibited shifts to earlier flowering over the last 70 years and eight of which have not. We manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses and then observed pollinator visitation in the field. Five of six species with historically advanced flowering received more visits when flowering was experimentally advanced, whereas seven of eight species with historically unchanged flowering received fewer visits when flowering earlier. This pattern suggests that species unconstrained by pollinators have advanced their flowering, whereas species constrained by pollinators have not. In contrast to current concern about phenological mismatches disrupting plant-pollinator mutualisms, mismatches at the onset of flowering are not occurring for most of our study species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is a long-term condition that requires self-management, but currently, there is no well-evaluated epilepsy self-education or self-management intervention in the United Kingdom (UK).

AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the views and experiences of the first participants of the Self-Management in epILEpsy UK (SMILE UK) program to assist the development of a full trial.

METHOD: In-depth semistructured interviews and group discussions were conducted with 10 people with poorly controlled epilepsy to explore their views and experiences of the self-management program. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.

RESULTS: All participants viewed the program positively. Three themes emerged: i) peer support was experienced through knowledge sharing, disclosure of experiences, and exchange of contact details; ii) participants felt better equipped to enter discussions with doctors and other health-care professionals about their condition; and iii) participants reported an improvement in their personal life through increased confidence to live with epilepsy and acceptance of their diagnosis.

CONCLUSION: A brief group self-management intervention increased knowledge and confidence in managing epilepsy.},

abstract = {Accurately scaling sap flux observations to tree or stand levels requires accounting for variation in sap flux between wood types and by depth into the tree. However, existing models for radial variation in axial sap flux are rarely used because they are difficult to implement, there is uncertainty about their predictive ability and calibration measurements are often unavailable. Here we compare different models with a diverse sap flux data set to test the hypotheses that radial profiles differ by wood type and tree size. We show that radial variation in sap flux is dependent on wood type but independent of tree size for a range of temperate trees. The best-fitting model predicted out-of-sample sap flux observations and independent estimates of sapwood area with small errors, suggesting robustness in the new settings. We develop a method for predicting whole-tree water use with this model and include computer code for simple implementation in other studies.},

abstract = {Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) water use was assessed by sap flux density measurements with the aim to establish the method and derive water-use characteristics. Thermal dissipation probes were inserted into leaf petioles of mature oil palms. In the laboratory, we tested our set-up against gravimetric measurements and derived new parameters for the original calibration equation that are specific to oil palm petioles. In the lowlands of Jambi, Indonesia, in a 12-year-old monoculture plantation, 56 leaves on 10 palms were equipped with one sensor per leaf. A 10-fold variation in individual leaf water use among leaves was observed, but we did not find significant correlations to the variables trunk height and diameter, leaf azimuthal orientation, leaf inclination or estimated horizontal leaf shading. We thus took an un-stratified approach to determine an appropriate sampling design to estimate stand transpiration (Es, mm day(-1)) rates of oil palm. We used the relative standard error of the mean (SEn, {\%}) as a measure for the potential estimation error of Es associated with sample size. It was 14{\%} for a sample size of 13 leaves to determine the average leaf water use and four palms to determine the average number of leaves per palm. Increasing these sample sizes only led to minor further decreases of the SEn of Es. The observed 90-day average of Es was 1.1 mm day(-1) (error margin ± 0.2 mm day(-1)), which seems relatively low, but does not contradict Penman-Monteith-derived estimates of evapotranspiration. Examining the environmental drivers of Es on an intra-daily scale indicates an early, pre-noon maximum of Es rates (11 am) due to a very sensitive reaction of Es to increasing vapor pressure deficit in the morning. This early peak is followed by a steady decline of Es rates for the rest of the day, despite further rising levels of vapor pressure deficit and radiation; this results in pronounced hysteresis, particularly between Es and vapor pressure deficit.},

This development, along with the identification of molecular mechanisms of epidermal signaling, maintenance, and differentiation, points to a need for new therapeutic alternatives to treat and prevent skin aging. In addition to recovering age- and sun-compromised functions, proper treatment of the epidermis has important esthetic implications. This study reviews active ingredients capable of counteracting symptoms of epidermal aging, organized according to the regulation of specific age-affected epidermal functions: (1) several compounds, other than retinoids and derivatives, act on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, supporting the protective barrier against mechanical and chemical insults; (2) natural lipidic compounds, as well as glycerol and urea, are described as agents for maintaining water-ion balance; (3) regulation of immunological pathogen defense can be reinforced by natural extracts and compounds, such as resveratrol; and (4) antioxidant exogenous sources enriched with flavonoids and vitamin C, for example, improve solar radiation protection and epidermal antioxidant activity. The main objective is to provide a functional classification of active ingredients as regulatory elements of epidermal homeostasis, with potential cosmetic and/or dermatological applications.},

abstract = {Climate change has resulted in major changes in the phenology—i.e. the timing of seasonal activities, such as flowering and bird migration—of some species but not others. These differential responses have been shown to result in ecological mismatches that can have negative fitness consequences. However, the ways in which climate change has shaped changes in biodiversity within and across communities are not well understood. Here, we build on our previous results that established a link between plant species{\&}{\#}039; phenological response to climate change and a phylogenetic bias in species{\&}{\#}039; decline in the eastern United States. We extend a similar approach to plant and bird communities in the United States and the UK that further demonstrates that climate change has differentially impacted species based on their phylogenetic relatedness and shared phenological responses. In plants, phenological responses to climate change are often shared among closely related species (i.e. clades), even between geographically disjunct communities. And in some cases, this has resulted in a phylogenetically biased pattern of non-native species success. In birds, the pattern of decline is phylogenetically biased but is not solely explained by phenological response, which suggests that other traits may better explain this pattern. These results illustrate the ways in which phylogenetic thinking can aid in making generalizations of practical importance and enhance efforts to predict species{\&}{\#}039; responses to future climate change.},

abstract = {We model the evolution of allochronic isolation between sympatric animal-pollinated plant species via displacement of their flowering times. The plant species share generalist pollinators and either produce inviable hybrid seeds or do not hybridize at all. Displacement of flowering times between reproductively isolated species reduces competition for pollinators and the formation of inviable hybrid seeds. Under strong pollen limitation, competition for pollinators causes rapid evolution of allochronic isolation both for hybridizing and nonhybridizing species. Under weak pollen limitation, allochronic isolation evolves rapidly for hybridizing species but more slowly for nonhybridizing species. Positive density-dependent pollinator visitation rate at low flower densities facilitates allochronic isolation under weak pollen limitation. Allochronic isolation among sympatric species sharing generalist pollinators could be common under any intensity of pollen limitation if the flowering season is sufficiently long.},

abstract = {Although the negative effect of epilepsy on patient's psychosocial well-being has been increasingly documented in the last decade, the influence of the condition on the family has attracted much less interest. This paper reviews the present state of family research, examining the influence of both childhood and adulthood epilepsy on the psychological and social well-being of family members. Studies indicate that epilepsy may cause high levels of psychosocial difficulties for all family members, including stigmatization, stress, psychiatric morbidity, marital problems, poor self esteem and restriction of social activities. Studies also suggest that the family environment may be an important intervening factor between the condition and the outcome for the family unit, and a number of family factors are reviewed which have been suggested to mediate this relationship, with recommendations being made for their use in intervention studies. Shortcomings of the family studies to date are discussed and these include: concentration on examination of issues around family life, studies being based on reports from single members of the family and the selection of subjects from clinical populations. Recommendations are made concerning methodological and conceptual issues that need addressing for future research.},

abstract = {The heat pulse method is widely used to measure water flux through plants; it works by using the speed at which a heat pulse is propagated through the system to infer the velocity of water through a porous medium. No systematic, non-destructive calibration procedure exists to determine the site-specific parameters necessary for calculating sap velocity, e.g., wood thermal diffusivity and probe spacing. Such parameter calibration is crucial to obtain the correct transpiration flux density from the sap flow measurements at the plant scale and subsequently to upscale tree-level water fluxes to canopy and landscape scales. The purpose of this study is to present a statistical framework for sampling and simultaneously estimating the tree's thermal diffusivity and probe spacing from in situ heat response curves collected by the implanted probes of a heat ratio measurement device. Conditioned on the time traces of wood temperature following a heat pulse, the parameters are inferred using a Bayesian inversion technique, based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The primary advantage of the proposed methodology is that it does not require knowledge of probe spacing or any further intrusive sampling of sapwood. The Bayesian framework also enables direct quantification of uncertainty in estimated sap flow velocity. Experiments using synthetic data show that repeated tests using the same apparatus are essential for obtaining reliable and accurate solutions. When applied to field conditions, these tests can be obtained in different seasons and can be automated using the existing data logging system. Empirical factors are introduced to account for the influence of non-ideal probe geometry on the estimation of heat pulse velocity, and are estimated in this study as well. The proposed methodology may be tested for its applicability to realistic field conditions, with an ultimate goal of calibrating heat ratio sap flow systems in practical applications.},

abstract = {Partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) into evaporation from the soil (E) and transpiration through the stomata of plants (T) is challenging but important in order to assess biomass production and the allocation of increasingly scarce water resources. Generally, T is the desired component with the water being used to enhance plant productivity; whereas, E is considered a source of water loss or inefficiency. The magnitude of E is expected to be quite significant in sparsely vegetated systems, particularly in dry areas or in very wet systems such as surface irrigated crops and wetlands. In these cases, ET partitioning is fundamental to accurately monitor system hydrology and to improve water management practices. This paper aims to evaluate and summarize available methods currently used to separately determine E and T components. We presuppose that, to test the accuracy of ET partitioning methods (measurements and/or modeling), all three components, i.e., E, T and ET, must be estimated independently, but recognize that sometimes one of the components is taken as the residual of the other two. Models that were validated against measurements for their ability to partition between E and T are briefly discussed. To compare approaches, 52 ET partitioning studies were considered regarding estimates of the relative amount of E and for success of agreement in closing the ET = E + T equation. The E/ET ratio was found to exceed 30{\%} in 32 of the studies, which confirms the hypothesis that E often constitutes a large fraction of ET and deserves independent consideration. Only 20 studies estimated E and T as well as ET, and had varied results. A number of studies succeeded to estimate E + T to within 10{\%} of measured ET. Future challenges include development of models simulating the components of ET separately and advancement of methods for continuous measurement of E, T and/or the ratio between the two.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin cancer and photoaging changes result from ultraviolet (UV)-induced oxidative stress. Topical antioxidants may protect skin from these effects.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a stable topical formulation of 15{\%} L-ascorbic acid, 1{\%} alpha-tocopherol, and 0.5{\%} ferulic acid (CEFer) could protect human skin in vivo from substantial amounts of solar-simulated UV radiation.

METHODS: CEFer and its vehicle were applied to separate patches of normal-appearing human skin for 4 days. Each patch was irradiated with solar-simulated UV, 2 to 10 minimal erythema doses, at 2-minimal erythema dose intervals. One day later, skin was evaluated for erythema and sunburn cells, and immunohistochemically for thymine dimers and p53. UV-induced cytokine formation, including interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

RESULTS: CEFer provided significant and meaningful photoprotection for skin by all methods of evaluation.

LIMITATIONS: The number of patients evaluated was relatively small.

CONCLUSION: CEFer provided substantial UV photoprotection for skin. It is particularly effective for reducing thymine dimer mutations known to be associated with skin cancer. Its mechanism of action is different from sunscreens and would be expected to supplement the sun protection provided by sunscreens.},

abstract = {Advances in spring blooming of wildflowers have been associated with climate change; however, the majority of long-term community-level studies have been conducted in humid-temperate regions. Less is known about phenological changes in herbaceous, semi-arid plant communities. We recorded first-bloom date of common spring wildflowers in a semi-arid grassland in the Rocky Mountains, USA from 1995 through 2008 and analyzed these data along with mean monthly temperature and precipitation. Advanced flowering predominated; 75{\%} of the 32 species displayed a negative linear regression slope, and this trend was strong for nine species (slope {\textless} 1.0, p {\textless} 0.10). Only one species showed a strong trend for later flowering. Mean advance for all 32 species was 0.61 days/year and mean advance for the nine species displaying a strong tendency to flower earlier was 1.6 days/year. Species flowering early showed stronger trends toward advanced flowering than later species. Average March temperature and January plus December precipitation, falling mainly as snow, were explanatory variables in the best multiple linear regression model for mean first-flowering date of strongly advanced species. Our results suggest that flowering phenology may be changing faster and precipitation may play a more important role in semi-arid grasslands than in humid-temperate systems.},

abstract = {Thermal dissipation probes (the Granier method) are routinely used in forest ecology and water balance studies to estimate whole-tree transpiration. This method utilizes an empirically derived equation to measure sap flux density, which has been reported as independent of wood characteristics. However, errors in calculated sap flux density may occur when large gradients in sap velocity occur along the sensor length or when sensors are inserted into non-conducting wood. These may be conditions routinely associated with ring-porous species, yet there are few cases in which the original calibration has been validated for ring-porous species. We report results from laboratory calibration measurements conducted on excised stems of four ring-porous species and two diffuse-porous species. Our calibration results for ring-porous species were considerably different compared with the original calibration equation. Calibration equation coefficients obtained in this study differed by as much as two to almost three orders of magnitude when compared with the original equation of Granier. Coefficients also differed between ring-porous species across all pressure gradient conditions considered; however, no differences between calibration slopes were observed for data collected within the range of expected in situ pressure gradients. In addition, dye perfusions showed that in three of the four ring-porous species considered, active sapwood was limited to the outermost growth ring. In contrast, our calibration results for diffuse-porous species showed generally good agreement with the empirically derived Granier calibration, and dye perfusions showed that active sapwood was associated with many annual growth rings. Our results suggest that the original calibration of Granier is not universally applicable to all species and xylem types and that previous estimates of absolute rates of water use for ring-porous species obtained using the original calibration coefficients may be associated with substantial error.},

abstract = {1. Solitary bees are central place foragers returning to their nests several times a day with pollen and nectar to provision their brood cells. They are especially susceptible to landscape changes that lead to an increased spatial separation of suitable nesting sites and flower rich host plant stands. While knowledge of bee foraging ranges is currently growing, quantitative data on the costs of foraging flights are very scarce, although such data are crucial to understand bee population dynamics. 2. In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in an otherwise host plant free landscape. 3. The number of brood cells provisioned per time unit by H. adunca was found to decrease by 23{\%}, 31{\%} and 26{\%} with an increase in the foraging distance by 150, 200 and 300 m, respectively. The number of brood cells provisioned by C. rapunculi decreased by 46{\%} and 36{\%} with an increase in the foraging distance by 500 and 600 m, respectively. 4. Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H. adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower visitors. 5. The results of this study clearly indicate that a close neighbourhood of suitable nesting and foraging habitats is crucial for population persistence and thus conservation of endangered solitary bee species.},

abstract = {Five different methods of determining sap flow (SF), three based on heat pulse (compensation heat pulse, New Zealand-cHP-NZ; compensation heat pulse, Greenspan/Australia-cHP-G (South oriented), and cHP-G-EW (East and West oriented, average); non-compensation heat pulse, Ariel/Israel-ncHP), one based on stem heat balance (Dynamax/USA-SHB), and another based on heat dissipation (Granier/France-HD) were compared in an experiment performed on peach trees in Northeast Spain. Two irrigation treatments (drip-irrigated) were applied: a control and a stress treatment, the latter consisting of withholding water from day 190 to 199. Between 1 and 3 different systems were installed in some trees of both, the control and stress treatments. All the techniques reflected the evolution of water stress in the stressed trees with a very similar tendency and in agreement with the evolution of predawn water potential ($\Psi$p). $\Psi$p correlated well with sap flow (SF) determined with all the systems (r2 {\textgreater} 0.65) in the stress treatment, indicating that all the SF techniques detected changes in tree water status. The cHP-NZ system was the first to detect a SF reduction through the outer xylem vessels, as a response to water withholding. In control trees, daily SF rates provided by the three heat pulse and heat balance methods were well correlated with ETo and somewhat less with global radiation; all regressions improved on an hourly basis. Daily pattern and magnitude of mean SF rates monitored by the three heat pulse systems were quite similar in control trees. This was reflected by high regression coefficients when compared with each other. Higher SF rates recorded by ncHP methods in comparison with cHP-G and cHP-NZ might be attributed to technical limitations and to different sensor orientation. In an accompanying experiment, substantial differences between East and West location of the cHP-G sensors were observed, but when taking the mean value of those daily SF rates, differences between ncHP and cHP-G-EW were lower. Mean monthly crop coefficients, calculated by using SF data computed with ncHP method and soil evaporation as determined with microlysimeters, were 0.64 in July and 0.67 in August. SF systems can be used to detect plant water stress related to control, and might be useful for irrigation scheduling based on plant water status. The SF techniques analysed showed potential to better determine actual plant water necessities than other traditional methods, but a preceding calibration is needed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The evolution of lignified xylem allowed for the efficient transport of water under tension, but also exposed the vascular network to the risk of gas emboli and the spread of gas between xylem conduits, thus impeding sap transport to the leaves. A well-known hypothesis proposes that the safety of xylem (its ability to resist embolism formation and spread) should trade off against xylem efficiency (its capacity to transport water). We tested this safety–efficiency hypothesis in branch xylem across 335 angiosperm and 89 gymnosperm species. Safety was considered at three levels: the xylem water potentials where 12{\%}, 50{\%} and 88{\%} of maximal conductivity are lost. Although correlations between safety and efficiency were weak (r2 {\textless} 0.086), no species had high efficiency and high safety, supporting the idea for a safety–efficiency tradeoff. However, many species had low efficiency and low safety. Species with low efficiency and low safety were weakly associated (r2 {\textless} 0.02 in most cases) with higher wood density, lower leaf- to sap- wood-area and shorter stature. There appears to be no persuasive explanation for the considerable number of species with both low efficiency and low safety. These species represent a real challenge for understanding the evolution of xylem.},

abstract = {Despite the development of diversity indices in community ecology that incorporate both richness and evenness, pollination biologists commonly use only pollinator richness to estimate generalization. Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pollination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity estimates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65{\%} of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple richness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of generalization. Although incorporating labor-intensive measurements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be important for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfortunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are.},

abstract = {The thermal dissipation technique is widely used to estimate transpiration of individual trees and forest stands, but there are conflicting reports regarding its accuracy. We compared the rate of water uptake by stems of six tree species in potometers with sap flow (F S) estimates derived from thermal dissipation sensors to evaluate the accuracy of the technique. To include the full range of xylem anatomies (i.e., diffuse-porous, ring-porous, and tracheid), we used saplings of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), white oak (Quercus alba), American elm (Ulmus americana), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). In almost all instances, estimated F S deviated substantially from actual F S, with the discrepancy in cumulative F S ranging from 9 to 55{\%}. The thermal dissipation technique generally underestimated F S. There were a number of potential causes of these errors, including species characteristics and probe construction and installation. Species with the same xylem anatomy generally did not show similar relationships between estimated and actual F S, and the largest errors were in species with diffuse-porous (Populus deltoides, 34{\%}) and tracheid (Pinus taeda, 55{\%}) xylem anatomies, rather than ring-porous species Quercus alba (9{\%}) and Ulmus americana (15{\%}) as we had predicted. New species-specific $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameter values only modestly improved the accuracy of F S estimates. However, the relationship between the estimated and actual F S was linear in all cases and a simple calibration based on the slope of this relationship reduced the error to 1–4{\%} in five of the species, and to 8{\%} in Liquidambar styraciflua. Our calibration approach compensated simultaneously for variation in species characteristics and sensor construction and use. We conclude that species-specific calibrations can substantially increase the accuracy of the thermal dissipation technique.},

abstract = {*$\backslash$nThe use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nThe presentation of ‘variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nOne reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nHere, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nThis method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

abstract = {Optimization theories explain a variety of forms and functions in plants. At the leaf scale, it is often hypothesized that carbon gain is maximized, thus providing a quantifiable objective for a mathematical definition of optimality conditions. Eco-physiological trade-offs and limited resource availability introduce natural bounds to this optimization process. In particular, carbon uptake from the atmosphere is inherently linked to water losses from the soil as water is taken up by roots and evaporated. Hence, water availability in soils constrains the amount of carbon that can be taken up and assimilated into new biomass. The problem of maximizing photosynthesis at a given water availability by modifying stomatal conductance, the plant-controlled variable to be optimized, has been traditionally formulated for short time intervals over which soil moisture changes can be neglected. This simplification led to a mathematically open solution, where the undefined Lagrange multiplier of the optimization (equivalent to the marginal water use efficiency, $\lambda$) is then heuristically determined via data fitting. Here, a set of models based on different assumptions that account for soil moisture dynamics over an individual dry-down are proposed so as to provide closed analytical expressions for the carbon gain maximization problem. These novel solutions link the observed variability in $\lambda$ over time, across soil moisture changes, and at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations to water use strategies ranging from intensive, in which all soil water is consumed by the end of the dry-down period, to more conservative, in which water stress is avoided by reducing transpiration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The rates of sap flow and xylem vessel features were studied in two-year-old nongrafted and grafted avocado (Persea americana Mill.) trees. Daily sap flow rates were measured with heat and balance stem gauges in clonal Duke 7 (D7) and Toro Canyon (TC) trees and 'Hass' clonal scions grafted onto clonal D7 (H/D7) and TC (H/TC) rootstocks. Vessel features as size, number and total vessel area were determined histologically in the stem of the scion and rootstock and the roots of the grafted trees. Significant differences in the sap flow rate were found among the rootstocks, where D7 had a 29{\%} higher sap flow rate than did TC (grafted and nongrafted trees). There were no differences among xylem vessel features in the stems of any of the varieties. However in the roots, D7 had wider and fewer vessels then TC do. Also, D7 had a 19{\%} higher total vessel area than TC. These results suggest that the differences in water consumption of 'Hass' on different rootstocks may be associated with differences in the efficiency of the roots to absorb water across conductive tissue which may be linked to differences in the area of xylem vessels in the root. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Unlike an ideal system, the return time to thermal balance (t(b)) between upstream and downstream thermistors, as measured by the (compensation) heat pulse velocity method, effectively depends on the heat input and the water content of the wood at zero and low sap flow. Even when these factors were held constant and ambient temperature was stabilized, a twofold variation in t(b) at zero flow was observed within and among Greenspan Technology sensors implanted in wooden posts, making it impossible to distinguish zero flow from low sap velocities ({\textless} 0.01-0.02 mm s(-1)). This limitation has serious consequences because the contribution of low flow rates to water movement is important during both daytime and nighttime in tropical understory and overstory trees. Measurements in an artificial flow system showed that this technical limitation is exacerbated by erratic variation in sensor response at both zero and low flow rates. The limited sensitivity of the tested sap flow sensors may be caused by their poor thermal contact with wood. Interim procedures are suggested for estimating minimum detectable sap flow and delimiting the hydroactive zone until the sensitivity and interchangeability of sap flow probes are improved.},

For individual trees, transpiration is commonly estimated by measuring sap flow. Besides evaporative demand and water availability, tree-specific characteristics such as species, size or social status control sap flow amounts of individual trees. Within forest stands, properties such as species composition, basal area or stand density additionally affect sap flow, for example via competition mechanisms. Finally, sap flow patterns might also be influenced by landscape-scale characteristics such as geology, slope position or aspect because they affect water and energy availability; however, little is known about the dynamic interplay of these controls. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We studied the relative importance of various tree-, stand- and site-specific characteristics with multiple linear regression models to explain the variability of sap velocity measurements in 61 beech and oak trees, located at 24 sites spread over a 290{\&}thinsp;km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-catchment in Luxembourg. For each of 132 consecutive days of the growing season of 2014 we modelled the daily sap velocities of these 61 trees and determined the importance of the different predictors. Results indicate that a combination of tree-, stand- and site-specific factors controls sap velocity patterns in the landscape, namely tree species, tree diameter, the stand density, geology and aspect. Compared to these predictors, spatial variability of atmospheric demand and soil moisture explains only a small fraction of the variability in the daily datasets. However, the temporal dynamics of the explanatory power of the tree-specific characteristics, especially species, are correlated to the temporal dynamics of potential evaporation. Thus, transpiration estimates at the landscape scale would benefit from not only considering hydro-meteorological drivers, but also including tree, stand and site characteristics in order to improve the spatial representation of transpiration for hydrological and soil{\&}ndash;vegetation{\&}ndash;atmosphere transfer models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Determination of the accuracy of commonly used techniques for measuring sap flux density in trees often presents a challenge. We therefore designed and built a verification system for heat-based sap flow sensors typically used at stem level. In the laboratory, a Mariotte's bottle device was used to maintain a constant flow rate of water through freshly cut stem segments of American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). This verification system was used to determine the accuracy of three heat-based sap flux density techniques: heat pulse velocity, thermal dissipation and heat field deformation. All three techniques substantially underestimated sap flux density when compared against gravimetric measurements. On average the actual sap flux density was underestimated by 35{\%} using heat pulse velocity, 46{\%} using heat field deformation and 60{\%} using thermal dissipation. These differences were consistent across sap flux densities ranging from 5 to 80 cm(3) cm(-2) h(-1). Field measurements supported the relative sensor performance observed in the laboratory. Applying a sensor-specific correction factor based on the laboratory test to the field data produced similar estimates of sap flux density from all three techniques. We concluded that a species-specific calibration is therefore necessary when using any of these techniques to insure that accurate estimates of sap flux density are obtained, at least until a physical basis for error correction can be proposed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Being well-informed and knowledgeable about their illnesses would be a great advantage to children with epilepsy (CWE). Subsequently, an effective education programme which could secure interest and simultaneously improve their awareness, knowledge and attitudes (AKA) is essential in enhancing well-being and health outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the development of a new interactive animated epilepsy education programme (IAEEP) for children and to assess its feasibility, acceptability and practicality.

METHODS: The IAEEP was developed by an interdisciplinary group of neurologist, paediatrician, pharmacist, biomedical scientist and educators which was based on two established epilepsy education programmes: the educational programme for patients with epilepsy and their relatives (MOSES) and the modular educational program for children with epilepsy and their parents (FAMOSES). CWE from paediatric department of three general hospitals in Terengganu were initially introduced to the IAEEP and were requested to complete an evaluation form assessing its feasibility, acceptability and practicality. Descriptive statistics were employed for data analyses (SPSS 20.0).

RESULTS: Sixteen CWE (median age=13.0; male=56.2{\%}; Malay=81.2{\%}; secondary school=56.2{\%}) and their corresponding parents were recruited. Each CWE owned at least a computer/notebook/tablet (100{\%}). The cost of distribution of IAEEP (in compact disc form) among CWE was estimated at about MYR 17.99/USD 5.90 per CWE. The average time required to interact with the programme was 22.8 minutes (SD=3.3, range 18-28 minutes). The programme was 100{\%} acceptable and received full support from both CWE and their parents (100{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: The favourable findings from this study add to the growing evidence suggesting that investment in interactive and animated education programme would be both feasible, well-received by patients and could be a potentially valuable approach to increase access and effectiveness of epilepsy care especially among CWE.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: New methods to protect skin from photodamage from sun exposure are necessary if we are to conquer skin cancer and photoaging. Sunscreens are useful, but their protection is not ideal because of inadequate use, incomplete spectral protection, and toxicity. Skin naturally uses antioxidants (AOs) to protect itself from photodamage. This scientific review summarizes what is known about how photodamage occurs; why sunscreens--the current gold standard of photoprotection--are inadequate; and how topical AOs help protect against skin cancer and photoaging changes. This review is intended to be a reference source, including pertinent comprehensive reviews whenever available. Although not all AOs are included, an attempt has been made to select those AOs for which sufficient information is available to document their potential topical uses and benefits. Reviewed are the following physiologic and plant AOs: vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, silymarin, soy isoflavones, and tea polyphenols. Their topical use may favorably supplement sunscreen protection and provide additional anticarcinogenic protection. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2003;48:1-19.)

LEARNING OBJECTIVE: At the completion of this learning activity, participants should have an understanding of current information about how the sun damages skin to produce skin cancer and photoaging changes, how the skin naturally protects itself from the sun, the shortcomings of sunscreens, and the added advantages of topical AOs for photoprotection.},

abstract = {A variety of thermal approaches are used to estimate sap flux density in stems of woody plants. Models have proved valuable tools for interpreting the behavior of heat pulse, heat balance and heat field deformation techniques, but have seldom been used to describe heat transfer dynamics for the heat dissipation method. Therefore, to better understand the behavior of heat dissipation probes, a model was developed that takes into account the thermal properties of wood, the physical dimensions and thermal characteristics of the probes, and the conductive and convective heat transfer that occurs due to water flow in the sapwood. Probes were simulated as aluminum tubes 20 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter, whereas sapwood, heartwood and bark each had a density and water fraction that determined their thermal properties. Base simulations assumed a constant sap flux density with sapwood depth and no wounding or physical disruption of xylem beyond the 2 mm diameter hole drilled for probe installation. Simulations across a range of sap flux densities showed that the dimensionless quantity k [defined as ($\Delta$T(m) -$\Delta$T)/$\Delta$T, where $\Delta$T(m) is the temperature differential ($\Delta$T) between the heated and unheated probe under zero-flow conditions] was dependent on the thermal conductivity of the sapwood. The relationship between sap flux density and k was also sensitive to radial gradients in sap flux density and to xylem disruption near the probe. Monte Carlo analysis in which 1000 simulations were conducted while simultaneously varying thermal conductivity and wound diameter revealed that sap flux density and k showed considerable departure from the original calibration equation used with this technique. The departure was greatest for variation in sap flux density typical of ring-porous species. Depending on the specific combination of thermal conductivity and wound diameter, use of the original calibration equation resulted in an 81{\%} under- to 48{\%} overestimation of sap flux density at modest flux rates. Future studies should verify these simulations and assess their utility in estimating sap flux density for this widely used technique.},

abstract = {People with chronic epilepsy (PWE) often make costly, and clinically unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits. Some do it frequently. No studies have examined interventions to reduce them. An intervention delivered by an epilepsy nurse specialist (ENS) might reduce visits. The rationale is it may optimize patients' self-management skills and knowledge of appropriate ED use. We examined such an intervention's clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Eighty-five adults with epilepsy were recruited from three London EDs with similar catchment populations. Forty-one PWE recruited from two EDs received treatment-as-usual (TAU) and formed the comparison group. The remaining 44 PWE were recruited from the ED of a hospital that had implemented a new ENS service for PWE attending ED. These participants formed the intervention group. They were offered 2 one-to-one sessions with an ENS, plus TAU. Participants completed questionnaires on health service use and psychosocial well-being at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Covariates were identified and adjustments made. Sixty-nine (81{\%}) participants were retained at follow-up. No significant effect of the intervention on ED visits at 12 months or on other outcomes was found. However, due to less time as inpatients, the average service cost for intervention participants over follow-up was less than for TAU participants' (adjusted difference {\pounds}558, 95{\%} CI, -{\pounds}2409, {\pounds}648). Covariates most predictive of subsequent ED visits were patients' baseline feelings of stigmatization due to epilepsy and low confidence in managing epilepsy. The intervention did not lead to a reduction in ED use, but did not cost more, partly because those receiving the intervention had shorter hospital admissions. Our findings on long-term ED predictors clarifies what causes ED use, and suggests that future interventions might focus more on patients' perceptions of stigma and on their confidence in managing epilepsy. If addressed, ED visits might be reduced and efficiency-savings generated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterization of mechanisms that can reverse residual damage from prior skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) would be of considerable biological and therapeutic interest. Topical caffeine application to mouse skin that had previously been treated with UV has been shown to inhibit the subsequent development of squamous cell carcinomas.

OBJECTIVES: We used an established mouse photodamage model to investigate other possible effects of topical caffeine application after UV.

METHODS: SKH-1 hairless mice were treated with ultraviolet B (UVB) followed immediately by topical application of caffeine or vehicle three times weekly for 11 weeks.

RESULTS: Caffeine applied topically after UV treatment resulted in a significant decrease in UV-induced skin roughness/transverse rhytides as assessed by treatment-blinded examiners. Histologically, topical caffeine application after a single dose of UVB more than doubled the number of apoptotic keratinocytes as evaluated by sunburn cell formation, caspase 3 cleavage and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining. A trend towards decreased solar elastosis was noted in the caffeine-treated group although this was not statistically significant. Other histological parameters including epidermal hyperplasia, solar elastosis and angiogenesis were increased in mice treated with UV but topical application of caffeine did not alter these particular UV effects.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the concept that topical application of caffeine to mouse skin after UV irradiation promotes the deletion of DNA-damaged keratinocytes and may partially diminish photodamage as well as photocarcinogenesis.},

METHODS: Outpatients filled out questionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 questionnaire, the stigma scale, and a questionnaire on episodes of discrimination. Patients were asked to fill out the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) Concerns Index and to list their concerns on a blank sheet of paper.

RESULTS: Of the 178 participants, 152 described a total of 470 concerns, which could be assorted into 25 distinct concerns. Worrying about the hereditability of their condition was the only concern that differed significantly between individuals with controlled and uncontrolled seizures. Three significant factors were identified on the total EFA Concerns Index score: level of anxiety/depression (34.4{\%}), age (6.3{\%}), and degree of social discrimination (4.3{\%}), resulting in a total explained variance of 45.0{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS: Korean adults with epilepsy had various concerns, with some differing from those in Western populations. Anxiety/depression, age and degree of discrimination were significantly associated with the degree of concern in Korean patients with epilepsy.},

The impact on quality of life has been well documented, and many studies have addressed the detrimental influences epilepsy has on an individual. However, the emotional impact and the influence of the condition on family members have not been well studied. Furthermore, the majority of the studies on this topic have been confined to childhood epilepsy, and there is only scarce literature that discusses the effects on family members caring for adult patients. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the influence of adult epilepsy on the psychological and social well-being of individual family members. We explored the psychological and physical well-being, satisfaction with social circumstances, and perceived level of support in families of adult patients with intractable epilepsy. The paper also suggests best practices on how to improve the family's quality of life, as well as future directions for research. Superior medical care and a positive family support system are important conditions that can help adult individuals with epilepsy best deal with their condition.},

abstract = {Thermal dissipation probes (TDPs) were calibrated in three diffuse porous fruit trees and one ornamental species in the field by comparison with heat pulse probes (nectarine and persimmon), in a greenhouse on lysimeters (apple and persimmon) and in the laboratory by pushing water through cut branches (apple, Peltophorum and nectarine). Two operational methods were used: continuous (constant thermal dissipation, CTD) and discontinuous, or transient, heating (transient thermal dissipation, TTD). Correction for the radial distribution of sap flux density was with an analytical function derived from a linear decrease in flux density with depth, as measured with a multi-depth ‘Tmax' heat pulse system. When analyzed with previous calibration factors, the measured sap flow was {\textless}50{\%} of actual value. The underestimations were consistent, and calibrations for each species in the field, greenhouse and laboratory gave approximately the same factors. Reasonable values of tree water use were obtained with the new calibration factors. Evidence is provided that even though the xylem was diffuse porous, the underestimations were caused by contact of the probes with inactive xylem along their length. The average portion of probe in contact with inactive xylem, measured in stained branches following laboratory calibrations, was 0.2–0.24. Using the measured fractions to correct temperature differentials between heated and unheated probes for CTD and TTD, based on Clearwater et al. (in Potential errors in measurement of nonuniform sap flow using heat dissipation probes. Tree Physiol 1999;19:681–687) almost completely compensated for the underestimations. Calibrations are given for each species both before and after corrections of temperature differentials, along with a multispecies calibration. These results should be an important step in reconciling many reports of different calibration factors for TDP probes.},

Preclinically, systemically and topically applied green tea extract (GTE) has shown reduction of UV-induced (i) erythema, (ii) DNA damage, (iii) formation of radical oxygen species and (iv) downregulation of numerous factors related to apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation and carcinogenesis. In humans, topical GTE has so far only been tested in limited studies, with usually very high GTE concentrations and over short periods of time. Both chemical stability of GTE and staining properties of highly concentrated green tea polyphenols limit the usability of highly concentrated green tea extracts in cosmetic products. The present study tested the utility of stabilized low-dose GTE as photochemopreventive agents under everyday conditions. We irradiated with up to 100 mJ/cm(2) of UVB light skin patches which were pretreated with either OM24-containing lotion or a placebo lotion. Biopsies were taken from both irradiated and un-irradiated skin for both immunohistochemistry and DNA microarray analysis. We found that while OM24 treatment did not significantly affect UV-induced erythema and thymidine dimer formation, OM24 treatment significantly reduced UV-induced p53 expression in keratinocytes. We also found that OM24 treatment significantly reduced the number of apoptotic keratinocytes (sunburn cells and TUNEL-positive cells). Carefully controlled DNA microarray analyses showed that OM24 treatment does not induce off-target changes in gene expression, reducing the likelihood of unwanted side-effects. Topical GTE (OM24) reduces UVB-mediated epithelial damage already at low, cosmetically usable concentrations, without tachyphylaxis over 5 weeks, suggesting GTE as suitable everyday photochemopreventive agents.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Key message: Analysis of sap flux density during drought suggests that the large sapwood and rooting volumes of larger trees provide a buffer against drying soil. Abstract: The southern conifer Agathis australis is amongst the largest and longest-lived trees in the world. We measured sap flux densities (Fd) in kauri trees with a DBH range of 20–176 cm to explore differences in responses of trees of different sizes to seasonal conditions and summer drought. Fd was consistently higher in larger trees than smaller trees. Peak Fd was 20 and 8 g m−2 s−1 for trees of diameters of 176 and 20 cm, respectively, during the wet summer. Multiple regression analysis revealed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and vapour pressure deficit (D) were the main drivers of Fd. During drought, larger trees were more responsive to D whilst smaller trees were more responsive to soil drying. Our largest tree had a sapwood area of 3,600 cm2. Preliminary analysis suggests stem water storage provides a buffer against drying soil in larger trees. Furthermore, Fd of smaller trees had higher R2 values for soil moisture at 30 and 60 cm depth than soil moisture at 10 cm depth (R2 = 0.68–0.97 and 0.55–0.67, respectively) suggesting that deeper soil moisture is more important for these trees. Larger trees did not show a relationship between Fd and soil moisture, suggesting they were accessing soil water deeper than 60 cm. These results suggest that larger trees may be better prepared for increasing frequency and intensity of summer droughts due to deeper roots and/or larger stem water storage capacity.},

abstract = {Growing concern about the influence of climate change on flowering plants, pollinators, and the mutualistic interactions between them has led to a recent surge in research. Much of this research has addressed the consequences of warming for phenological and distributional shifts. In contrast, relatively little is known about the physiological responses of plants and insect pollinators to climate warming and, in particular, how these responses might affect plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we summarize the direct physiological effects of temperature on flowering plants and pollinating insects to highlight ways in which plant and pollinator responses could affect floral resources for pollinators, and pollination success for plants, respectively. We also consider the overall effects of these responses on plant-pollinator interaction networks. Plant responses to warming, which include altered flower, nectar, and pollen production, could modify floral resource availability and reproductive output of pollinating insects. Similarly, pollinator responses, such as altered foraging activity, body size, and life span, could affect patterns of pollen flow and pollination success of flowering plants. As a result, network structure could be altered as interactions are gained and lost, weakened and strengthened, even without the gain or loss of species or temporal overlap. Future research that addresses not only how plant and pollinator physiology are affected by warming but also how responses scale up to affect interactions and networks should allow us to better understand and predict the effects of climate change on this important ecosystem service},

abstract = {In a world of diminishing water reservoirs and a rising demand for food, the practice and development of water stress indicators and sensors are in rapid progress. The heat dissipation method, originally established by Granier, is herein applied and modified to enable sap flow measurements in date palm trees in the southern Arava desert of Israel. A long and tough sensor was constructed to withstand insertion into the date palm's hard exterior stem. This stem is wide and fibrous, surrounded by an even tougher external non-conducting layer of dead leaf bases. Furthermore, being a monocot species, water flow does not necessarily occur through the outer part of the palm's stem, as in most trees. Therefore, it is highly important to investigate the variations of the sap flux densities and determine the preferable location for sap flow sensing within the stem. Once installed into fully grown date palm trees stationed on weighing lysimeters, sap flow as measured by the modified sensors was compared with the actual transpiration. Sap flow was found to be well correlated with transpiration, especially when using a recent calibration equation rather than the original Granier equation. Furthermore, inducing the axial variability of the sap flux densities was found to be highly important for accurate assessments of transpiration by sap flow measurements. The sensors indicated no transpiration at night, a high increase of transpiration from 06:00 to 09:00, maximum transpiration at 12:00, followed by a moderate reduction until 08:00; when transpiration ceased. These results were reinforced by the lysimeters' output. Reduced sap flux densities were detected at the stem's mantle when compared with its center. These results were reinforced by mechanistic measurements of the stem's specific hydraulic conductivity. Variance on the vertical axis was also observed, indicating an accelerated flow towards the upper parts of the tree and raising a hypothesis concerning dehydrating mechanisms of the date palm tree. Finally, the sensors indicated reduction in flow almost immediately after irrigation of field-grown trees was withheld, at a time when no climatic or phenological conditions could have led to reduction in transpiration.},

abstract = {A measurement of the ascent of xylem sap in a tree trunk has implications in the fields of hydrology and physiology. Taken over a sufficiently long time period, the quantity of sap flow upward through the stem must equal transpiration at the leaves. The occurrence of transpiration indicates that stomata are open, a necessary condition for gas exchange during photosynthesis. Various thermometric methods have been tried to estimate xylem sap flow. The earliest attempts used simple relationships between the first onset of an induced heat pulse measured at one or more points downstream in the stem from the heat induction site. This was followed by a compensation technique in which heat flow in both the upstream and downstream directions was detected to allow for conduction, as well as advection of heat from one point to another. Lastly, stem anatomy was considered mathematically and various sap velocity (heat pulse velocity) and sap flux methods (thermal heat balance) were proposed to place quantitative thermometric methods on a sound physical and theoretical base. A close examination of modern thermometric methods of measuring xylem sap flow will reveal that there is no one set of theory and instrumentation that is applicable to all sizes or species of trees. Trees have three major xylem sap conducting systems that present quite different physical systems from the standpoint of the theory of the conduction and advection of heat in the sap stream within them. Furthermore, an instrumentation technique that may work satisfactorily on large tree stems (more than 5-6 cm in diameter) will generally not work on smaller stems because of unknown heat losses. Thermal heat balance (THB) methods are inherently more quantitative than those relying on heat pulse velocities (HPV). However, THB techniques require more complex instrumentation than HPV methods. And, perhaps more importantly, THB methods require considerable power, an important consideration in field situations away from electrical mains. In general a combination of THB and HPV methods should be the most useful. The quantity of sap flow determined with a THB method can be used to calibrate simultaneous velocity measurements made with HPV apparatus. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {The paper describes the evidence on potential effects of specially trained nurses working in primary care for patients with epilepsy. The method used was a search and review of evidence published from 1992 to 1999. It was found that where nurses have been trained in epilepsy care, there is good evidence that it is feasible for them to set up and run clinics in family practice. Where this has been undertaken, there is level I evidence that this is acceptable and satisfactory to patients. Where clinics have been set up in primary care, there is level I evidence that there has been an increase in the information and advice recorded as being provided to patients. Structured checklists may additionally prompt service providers to increase the level of information provided to patients, and this hypothesis is being tested currently. In conclusion, epilepsy nurses can set up clinics for patients in primary care which are well attended, satisfy patients, and which are associated with better recording of advice given. There is little published evidence on outcome as opposed to process measures. Trials with adequate sample size and long-term follow-up are necessary to identify whether nurse monitoring with advice and counselling can benefit patients in terms of epilepsy self-management in the long run.},

abstract = {The terrestrial water and carbon cycles are coupled through plant regulation of stomatal closure.

However, plants vary in the degree to which they regulate their stomata[mdash]and in association, xylem conductance[mdash]in response to increasing aridity: isohydric plants exert tight regulation of stomata and the water content of the plant, whereas anisohydric plants do not. Here we use remote-sensing data sets of anisohydricity and vegetation greenness to show that productivity in United States grasslands[mdash]especially anisohydric ones[mdash]is far more sensitive to variations in vapour pressure deficit than to variations in precipitation. Anisohydric ecosystem productivity is over three times more sensitive to vapour pressure deficit than isohydric ecosystem productivity. The precipitation sensitivity of summer productivity increases with anisohydricity only for the most anisohydric ecosystems. We conclude that increases in vapour pressure deficit rather than changes in precipitation[mdash]both of which are expected impacts of climate change[mdash]will be a dominant influence on future grassland productivity.},

abstract = {Melatonin is a highly conserved molecule. Its presence can be traced back to ancient photosynthetic prokaryotes. A primitive and primary function of melatonin is that it acts as a receptor-independent free radical scavenger and a broad-spectrum antioxidant. The receptor-dependent functions of melatonin were subsequently acquired during evolution. In the current review, we focus on melatonin metabolism which includes the synthetic rate-limiting enzymes, synthetic sites, potential regulatory mechanisms, bioavailability in humans, mechanisms of breakdown and functions of its metabolites. Recent evidence indicates that the original melatonin metabolite may be N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) rather than its commonly measured urinary excretory product 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate. Numerous pathways for AFMK formation have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. These include enzymatic and pseudo-enzymatic pathways, interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and with ultraviolet irradiation. AFMK is present in mammals including humans, and is the only detectable melatonin metabolite in unicellular organisms and metazoans. 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate has not been observed in these low evolutionary-ranked organisms. This implies that AFMK evolved earlier in evolution than 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate as a melatonin metabolite. Via the AFMK pathway, a single melatonin molecule is reported to scavenge up to 10 ROS/RNS. That the free radical scavenging capacity of melatonin extends to its secondary, tertiary and quaternary metabolites is now documented. It appears that melatonin's interaction with ROS/RNS is a prolonged process that involves many of its derivatives. The process by which melatonin and its metabolites successively scavenge ROS/RNS is referred as the free radical scavenging cascade. This cascade reaction is a novel property of melatonin and explains how it differs from other conventional antioxidants. This cascade reaction makes melatonin highly effective, even at low concentrations, in protecting organisms from oxidative stress. In accordance with its protective function, substantial amounts of melatonin are found in tissues and organs which are frequently exposed to the hostile environmental insults such as the gut and skin or organs which have high oxygen consumption such as the brain. In addition, melatonin production may be upregulated by low intensity stressors such as dietary restriction in rats and exercise in humans. Intensive oxidative stress results in a rapid drop of circulating melatonin levels. This melatonin decline is not related to its reduced synthesis but to its rapid consumption, i.e. circulating melatonin is rapidly metabolized by interaction with ROS/RNS induced by stress. Rapid melatonin consumption during elevated stress may serve as a protective mechanism of organisms in which melatonin is used as a first-line defensive molecule against oxidative damage. The oxidative status of organisms modifies melatonin metabolism. It has been reported that the higher the oxidative state, the more AFMK is produced. The ratio of AFMK and another melatonin metabolite, cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, may serve as an indicator of the level of oxidative stress in organisms.},

Evergreen broad-leaved oaks (Lithocarpus, Castanopsis, Cyclobalanopsis, Quercus) belonging to the Quercoideae are a major component of Asian monsoon forests, and are characterized by the possession of radial-porous wood. A characteristic of radial-porous wood is the development of aggregate rays between radially oriented files of vessels. We measured the distribution of vessel lumen diameters in a stem cross section and calculated the theoretical water conductivity of the wood. The radial profile of the heat pulse velocity (HPV) was measured for an intact whole tree under field conditions and compared with the theoretical distribution of water conductivity. Soft X-ray photographs of frozen stem sections indicated that most of the vessel lumina were filled with water, including those of vessels more than 20 years old. Even when vessels were relatively wide (lumen diameters {\textgreater} 100 microm), cavitation was negligible. The rate of water uptake from the cut stem base correlated closely with HPV (r = 0.96), and HPV closely reflected the mean volume flow per stem sectional area (SFVS) around the sensor probes. However, the ray tissue sharply inhibited heat transfer, and the positioning of the probes strongly affected the absolute value of HPV. It was also found that HPV more closely reflected the mean sap flow velocity in the vessels than did SFVS.},

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tribe Cardueae (thistles) forms one of the largest tribes in the family Compositae (2400 species), with representatives in almost every continent. The greatest species richness of Cardueae occurs in the Mediterranean region where it forms an important element of its flora. New fossil evidence and a nearly resolved phylogeny of Cardueae are used here to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of this group. •

METHODS: We performed maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on nuclear ribosomal DNA and chloroplast DNA markers. Divergence times and ancestral area reconstructions for main lineages were estimated using penalized likelihood and dispersal-vicariance analyses, respectively, and integrated over the posterior distribution of the phylogeny from the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to accommodate uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships. •

KEY RESULTS: The phylogeny shows that subtribe Cardopatiinae is sister to the remaining subtribes, and subtribes Carlininae and Echinopsinae appear as consecutive sister-clades to the Carduinae/Centaureinae. Tribe Cardueae is inferred to have originated around the Mid Eocene in West Asia, which is also the ancestral area of most subtribes within Cardueae. Diversification within each subtribe began during the Oligocene-Miocene period. •

CONCLUSIONS: Most diversification events within Cardueae are related to the continuous cycles of area connection and division between the Anatolian microplate and the western Mediterranean Basin during the Oligocene-Miocene and with the uplift of the Himalayan range from the Miocene onward. From these two regions, thistles dispersed and colonized the rest of the continents (e.g., the New World, Africa, and Australia), most likely during the colder Pliocene-Pleistocene period.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal models, extracts from green tea have been shown to be remarkably effective at reducing the severity of adverse human health effects of overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although sunscreens and other photoprotective measures have traditionally been used for this purpose, there is a need for additional measures and natural products are increasingly being explored for that purpose.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of polyphenols from green tea on parameters associated with acute UV injury.

METHODS: Areas of skin of normal volunteers were treated with an extract of green tea or one of its constituents. Thirty minutes later, the treated sites were exposed to a 2 minimal erythema dose solar simulated radiation. UV-treated skin was examined clinically for UV-induced erythema, histologically for the presence of sunburn cells or Langerhans cell distributions, or biochemically for UV-induced DNA damage.

RESULTS: Application of green tea extracts resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the erythema response evoked by UV radiation. The (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) polyphenolic fractions were most efficient at inhibiting erythema, whereas (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) had little effect. On histologic examination, skin treated with green tea extracts reduced the number of sunburn cells and protected epidermal Langerhans cells from UV damage. Green tea extracts also reduced the DNA damage that formed after UV radiation.

CONCLUSION: Polyphenolic extracts of green tea are effective chemopreventive agents for many of the adverse effects of sunlight on human health and may thus serve as natural alternatives for photoprotection.},

abstract = {AIM: adult epilepsy clinic population: (a) to identify the frequency of seizure precipitants (triggering factors) and their relative frequency in those with psychiatric disorders, and in those in remission or with active epilepsy, differences in frequency with regard to gender, seizure duration, number of drugs taken; (b) to determine which precipitants patients most commonly report; and (c) to identify differences in the distribution of precipitants among generalized, temporal, and extratemporal epilepsies.

METHODS: Consecutive patients attending a tertiary-care epilepsy clinic were prospectively and an open personal interview to identify and characterize seizure precipitants. Information about the epilepsy and clinical characteristics of patients was collected during the interview and from medical records.

RESULTS: Of 104 patients, 97{\%} cited at least one precipitant. Stress, sleep deprivation, and fatigue were the most frequently reported precipitants. Patients with psychological comorbidities reported a greater percentage of seizures with seizure precipitants. Patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy seemed to be more sensitive to seizures during awakening and sleep deprivation, patients with extratemporal epilepsy reported more frequent seizures during sleep. There were no differences in frequency or type of seizure precipitants with regard to gender, seizure duration or frequency, and the number of antiepileptic drugs taken.

CONCLUSION: The findings may have implications for the better management of epilepsy by increasing a focus on nonpharmacological therapy. The implications of the findings for nosology and causation of epilepsy are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted during the past decade on species ranges and their relationship to the environment, our understanding of how environmental conditions shape species distribution is still far from complete. Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

abstract = {Pollinators represent an important intermediary by which different plant species can influence each other's reproductive fitness. Floral neighbors can modify the quantity of pollinator visits to a focal species but may also influence the composition of visitor assemblages that plants receive leading to potential changes in the average effectiveness of floral visits. We explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood (abundance of native and non-native heterospecific plants within 2 m {\{}$\backslash$texttimes{\}} 2 m) affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for a native plant, Phacelia parryi. The relative effectiveness of different insect visitors was also assessed to interpret the potential effects on plant fitness of shifts in pollinator assemblage composition. Although the common non-native Brassica nigra did not have a significant effect on overall pollinator visitation rate to P. parryi, the proportion of flower visits that were made by native pollinators increased with increasing abundance of heterospecific plant species in the floral neighborhood other than B. nigra. Furthermore, native pollinators deposited twice as many P. parryi pollen grains per visit as did the nonnative Apis mellifera, and visits by native bees also resulted in more seeds than visits by A. mellifera. These results indicate that the floral neighborhood can influence the composition of pollinator assemblages that visit a native plant and that changes in local flower communities have the potential to affect plant reproductive success through shifts in these assemblages towards less effective pollinators.},

abstract = {Widespread tree species must show physiological and structural plasticity to deal with contrasting water balance conditions. To investigate these plasticity mechanisms, a meta-analysis of Pinus sylvestris L. sap flow and its response to environmental variables was conducted using datasets from across its whole geographical range. For each site, a Jarvis-type, multiplicative model was used to fit the relationship between sap flow and photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit (D) and soil moisture deficit (SMD); and a logarithmic function was used to characterize the response of stomatal conductance (G(s)) to D. The fitted parameters of those models were regressed against climatic variables to study the acclimation of Scots pine to dry/warm conditions. The absolute value of sap flow and its sensitivity to D and SMD increased with the average summer evaporative demand. However, relative sensitivity of G(s) to D (m/G (s,ref), where m is the slope and G(s,ref) is reference G(s) at D = 1 kPa) did not increase with evaporative demand across populations, and transpiration per unit leaf area at a given D increased accordingly in drier/warmer climates. This physiological plasticity was linked to the previously reported climate- and size-related structural acclimation of leaf to sapwood area ratios. G (s,ref), and its absolute sensitivity to D(m), tended to decrease with age/height of the trees as previously reported for other pine species. It is unclear why Scots pines have higher transpiration rates at drier/warmer sites, at the expense of lower water-use efficiency. In any case, our results suggest that these structural adjustments may not be enough to prevent lower xylem tensions at the driest sites.},

abstract = {Plant transpiration is the main evaporative flux from terrestrial ecosystems; it controls land surface energy balance, determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate. Transpiration regulation by plants is a key (and still not completely understood) process that underlies vegetation drought responses and land evaporative fluxes under global change scenarios. Thermometric methods of sap flow measurement have now been widely used to quantify whole-plant and stand transpiration in forests, shrublands and orchards around the world. A large body of research has applied sap flow methods to analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of transpiration and to quantify their responses to hydroclimatic variability, but syntheses of sap flow data at regional to global scales are extremely rare. Here we present the SAPFLUXNET initiative, aimed at building the first global database of plant-level sap flow measurements. A preliminary metadata survey launched in December 2015 showed an encouraging response by the sap flow community, with sap flow data sets from field studies representing {\textgreater}160 species and {\textgreater}120 globally distributed sites. The main goal of SAPFLUXNET is to analyse the ecological factors driving plant- and stand-level transpiration. SAPFLUXNET will open promising research avenues at an unprecedented global scope, namely: (i) exploring the spatio-temporal variability of plant transpiration and its relationship with plant and stand attributes, (ii) summarizing physiological regulation of transpiration by means of few water-use traits, usable for land surface models, (iii) improving our understanding of the coordination between gas exchange and plant-level traits (e.g., hydraulics) and (iv) analysing the ecological factors controlling stand transpiration and evapotranspiration partitioning. Finally, SAPFLUXNET can provide a benchmark to test models of physiological controls of transpiration, contributing to improve the accuracy of individual water stress responses, a key element to obtain robust predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.},

abstract = {The empirical calibration of Granier-type heat dissipation sap flow probes that relate temperature difference ($\Delta$T) to sap velocity (v) was reevaluated in stems of three tropical tree species. The original calibration was confirmed when the entire heated probe was in contact with conducting xylem, but mean v was underestimated when part of the probe was in contact with nonconducting xylem or bark. Analysis of the effects of nonuniform sap velocity profiles on heat dissipation estimates showed that errors increased as v and the proportion of the probe in nonconducting wood increased. If half of a 20-mm probe is in sapwood with a v of 0.15 mm s−1 and the other half is in nonconducting wood, then mean v for the whole probe can be underestimated by as much as 50{\%}. A correction was developed that can be used if the proportion of the probe in nonconducting wood is known. Even with the entire heated probe in contact with conducting xylem, v would be underestimated when radial velocity gradients are present. In this case, the error would be smaller except when velocity gradients are very steep, as can occur in species with ring-porous wood anatomy. Errors occur because the relationship between $\Delta$T and v is nonlinear. Mean $\Delta$T along the probe is therefore not a measure of mean v, and users of heat dissipation probes should not assume that v is integrated along the length of the probe. The same type of error can occur when $\Delta$T is averaged through time while v is changing, but the error is small unless there are sudden, step changes between zero and high sap velocity. It is recommended that relatively short probes (20 mm or less) be used and that probes longer than the depth of conducting sapwood be avoided. Multiple probes inserted to a range of depths should be used in situations where steep gradients in v are expected. If these conditions are met, heat dissipation probes remain useful and widely applicable for measuring sap flow in woody stems.},

abstract = {Food limitation can reduce reproductive success directly, as well as indirectly, if foraging imposes a risk of predation or parasitism. The solitary bee Osmia pumila suffers brood parasitism by the cleptoparasitic wasp Sapyga centrata, which enters the host nest to oviposit while the female bee is away. I studied foraging and reproduction of O. pumila nesting within cages stocked with rich or sparse floral resources, and the presence or absence of S. centrata to test (1) the response of nesting female O. pumila to food shortages, (2) the response of nesting female O. pumila to the presence of parasites, and (3) whether brood produced under scarce resources are more likely to be parasitized by S. centrata. The rate of brood cell production was significantly lower in cages with sparse floral resources, although females in sparse cages did not produce significantly fewer brood cells overall. Sapyga centrata did not influence the rate of brood cell production, but females exposed to the cleptoparasites had marginally significantly lower reproductive output. Nests in parasite cages had significantly fewer brood cells than those in parasite free cages. The mean duration of foraging bouts made by female O. pumila in sparse cages was not significantly longer than that in rich cages. O. pumila spent less time in the nest between pollen and nectar foraging bouts in sparse cages with S. centrata than those in other cages suggesting that these individuals made more frequent food foraging trips. Despite the weak effects of parasites and bloom density on foraging behavior, O. pumila brood cells experienced a 5-fold higher probability of parasitism by S. centrata in cages with sparse bloom than in those with rich bloom [corrected]. These results support the hypothesis that indirect effects of food scarcity increase O. pumila susceptibility to brood parasitism, although the exact mechanism is not entirely clear yet.},

abstract = {Several heat-based sap flow methods, such as the heat field deformation method and the heat ratio method, include the thermal diffusivity D of the sapwood as a crucial parameter. Despite its importance, little attention has been paid to determine D in a plant physiological context. Therefore, D is mostly set as a constant, calculated during zero flow conditions or from a method of mixtures, taking into account wood density and moisture content. In this latter method, however, the meaning of the moisture content is misinterpreted, making it theoretically incorrect for D calculations in sapwood. A correction to this method, which includes the correct application of the moisture content, is proposed. This correction was tested for European and American beech and Eucalyptus caliginosa Blakely {\&} McKie. Depending on the dry wood density and moisture content, the original approach over- or underestimates D and, hence, sap flux density by 10{\%} and more.},

abstract = {Transpiration from a hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna L.) dominated hedgerow in southern England was measured continuously over two growing seasons by the sap flow technique. Accompanying measurements of structural parameters, microclimate and leaf stomatal and boundary layer conductances were used to establish the driving factors of hedgerow transpiration. Observed transpiration rates, reaching peak values of around 8 mm day(-1) and a seasonal mean of about 3.5 mm day(-1), were higher than those reported for most other temperate deciduous woodlands, except short-rotation coppice and wet woodlands. The high rates were caused by the structural and physiological characteristics of hawthorn leaves, which exhibited much higher stomatal and boundary-layer conductances than those of the second-most abundant woody species in the hedgerow, field maple (Acer campestre L.). Only in the hot summer of 2003 did stomatal conductance, and thus transpiration, decrease substantially. The hedgerow canopy was always closely coupled to the atmosphere. Hedgerow transpiration equaled potential evaporation (calculated by the Priestley-Taylor formula) in 2003 and exceeded it in 2004, which meant that a substantial fraction of the energy (21{\%} in 2003 and more than 37{\%} in 2004) came from advection. Hedgerow canopy conductance (g(c)), as inferred from the sap flow data by inverting the Penman-Monteith equation, responded to solar radiation (R(G)) and vapor pressure deficit (D). Although the response to R(G) showed no systematic temporal variation, the response to D, described as g(c)(D) = g(cref) - mln(D), changed seasonally. The reference g(c) depended on leaf area index and the ratio of -m/g(cref) on long-term mean daytime D. A model is proposed based on these observations that predicts canopy conductance for the hawthorn hedge from standard weather data.},

Our results support the syndrome concept, indicating that convergent floral evolution is driven by adaptation to the most effective pollinator group. The predictability of pollination syndromes is greater in pollinator-dependent species and in plants from tropical regions. Many plant species also have secondary pollinators that generally correspond to the ancestral pollinators documented in evolutionary studies.

The widely held hypothesis that successful invaders have high reproductive rates has received little empirical support; however, alternative possibilities are seldom considered. Combining a global comparative analysis of avian introductions ({\textgreater}2700 events) with demographic models and phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that although rapid population growth may be advantageous during invasions under certain circumstances, more generally successful invaders are characterized by life-history strategies in which they give priority to future rather than current reproduction. High future breeding expectations reduce the costs of reproductive failure under uncertain conditions and increase opportunities to explore the environment and respond to novel ecological pressures.},

abstract = {Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broad-scale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures—''hotter drought'', an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene—are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO 2 ] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.},

abstract = {Diurnal hysteresis between evapotranspiration (ET) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was reported in many ecosystems, but justification for its onset and magnitude remains incomplete with biotic and abiotic factors invoked as possible explanations. To place these explanations within a holistic framework, the occurrence of hysteresis was theoretically assessed along a hierarchy of model systems where both abiotic and biotic components are sequentially added. Lysimeter evaporation (E) measurements and model calculations using the Penman equation were used to investigate the effect of the time lag between net radiation and VPD on the hysteresis in the absence of any biotic effects. Modulations from biotic effects on the ET-VPD hysteresis were then added using soil-plant-atmosphere models of different complexities applied to a grassland ecosystem. The results suggest that the hysteresis magnitude depends on the radiation-VPD lag, while the plant and soil water potentials are both key factors modulating the hysteretic ET-VPD relation as soil moisture declines. In particular, larger hysteresis magnitude is achieved at less negative leaf water potential, root water potential, and soil water potential. While plant hydraulic capacitance affects the leaf water potential-ET relation, it has negligible effects on the ET-VPD hysteresis. Therefore, the genesis and magnitude of the ET-VPD hysteresis are controlled directly by both abiotic factors such as soil water availability, biotic factors (leaf and root water potentials, which in turn depend on soil moisture), and the time lag between radiation and VPD.},

Skin was processed for light microscopy, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). UVB-exposed skin had typical sunburn histology. TEM showed TiO(2) NP 17 layers into stratum corneum (SC), whereas ZnO remained on the surface. TOF-SIMS showed TiO(2) and ZnO epidermal penetration in both treatments. Perfusate analyzed by TEM/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detected no Ti or Zn, indicating minimal transdermal absorption. In vivo, skin was dosed at 24 h occluded with formulations and at 48 h. TiO(2) NP in o/w formulation penetrated 13 layers into UVB-damaged SC, whereas only 7 layers in normal skin; TiO(2) in w/o penetrated deeper in UVB-damaged SC. Coated and uncoated Zn NP in o/w were localized to the upper one to two SC layers in all skin. By SEM, NP were localized as agglomerates in formulation on the skin surface and base of hair. TOF-SIMS showed Ti within epidermis and superficial dermis, whereas Zn was limited to SC and upper epidermis in both treatments. In summary, UVB-damaged skin slightly enhanced TiO(2) NP or ZnO NP penetration in sunscreen formulations but no transdermal absorption was detected.},

Whilst expensive, it is not known how to reduce them. We recently conducted the first trial of an epilepsy-nurse specialist intervention which aimed to optimise self-management skills in PWE attending emergency departments and advise them on appropriate emergency services use. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews, we here report the perceived support needs of patients who have attended a emergency department for epilepsy and the benefits of the intervention which they identified. Nested qualitative study. After receiving the intervention, 20 participants were invited to interview. They described their experience of the intervention, to what extent they valued it and its benefits and limitations. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Most valued the additional support. Those who previously used emergency departments most perceived greatest benefit. Participants felt it redressed limitations to usual care, including providing information about living with epilepsy, and an opportunity to discuss feelings about epilepsy. Perceived benefits included improvements in emotional well-being, confidence dealing with seizures and medication adherence. The intervention was acceptable to patients. People with epilepsy who had attended a emergency department on more than one occasion perceived most benefit. This suggests they want additional care. Some perceived benefits in domains possibly causally related to emergency department use. This suggests the intervention, with optimisation, may have the components to reduce emergency department visits. Our results provide insights into how to support PWE who attend emergency departments and how needs differ amongst this group.},

Moreover, it is unknown whether species-rich AMF communities can act as insurance to maintain productivity in a fluctuating environment (e.g., upon changing soil conditions). We tested the impact of four different AMF taxa and of AMF diversity (no AMF, single AMF taxa, and all four together) on competitive interactions between the legume Trifolium pratense and the grass Lolium multiflorum grown under two different soil conditions of low and high sand content. We hypothesized that more diverse mutualistic interactions (e.g., when four AMF taxa are present) can ease competitive effects between plants, increase plant growth, and maintain plant productivity across different soil environments. We used quantitative PCR to verify that AMF taxa inoculated at the beginning of the experiment were still present at the end. The presence of AMF reduced the competitive inequality between the two plant species by reducing the growth suppression of the legume by the grass. High AMF richness enhanced the combined biomass production of the two plant species and the yield of the legume, particularly in the more productive soil with low sand content. In the less productive (high sand content) soil, the single most effective AMF had an equally beneficial effect on plant productivity as the mixture of four AMF. Since contributions of single AMF to plant productivity varied between both soils, higher AMF richness would be required to maintain plant productivity in heterogeneous environments. Overall this work shows that AMF diversity promotes plant productivity and that AMF diversity can act as insurance to sustain plant productivity under changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter patterns of species co-occurrence, in both space and time. Species-specific shifts in reproductive phenology may alter the assemblages of plant species in flower at any given time during the growing season. Temporal overlap in the flowering periods (co-flowering) of animal-pollinated species may influence reproductive success if competitive or facilitative interactions between plant species affect pollinator services. We used a 33-year data set on flowering phenology in subalpine meadows in Colorado, USA, to determine whether interannual variation in snowmelt date, which marks the start of the growing season, affected co-flowering patterns. For two of four species considered, we found a significant relationship between snowmelt timing and composition of the assemblage of co-flowering plants. In years of early snowmelt, Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus (Fabaceae), the species we investigated in most detail, tended to overlap with earlier-flowering species and with fewer species overall. In particular, overlap with the flowering period of Lupinus polyphyllus var. prunophilus, with which Lathyrus leucanthus shares pollinators, was significantly reduced in early-snowmelt years. The observed association between timing of snowmelt and patterns of flowering overlap could not have been predicted simply by examining temporal trends in the dates of peak flowering of the dominant species in the community, as peak flowering dates have largely shifted in parallel with respect to snowmelt date. However, subtle interspecific differences in responsiveness of flowering time, duration, and intensity to interannual climate variation have likely contributed to the observed relationship. Although much of the year-to-year variation in flowering overlap remains unexplained by snowmelt date, our finding of a measurable signal of climate variation suggests that future climate change may lead to altered competitive environments for these wildflower species.},

abstract = {The banana (Musa sp.) plant is one of the largest monocotyledoneous terrestrial herbaceous plants in the world. The measurement of transpiration (Tr) for a whole banana plant is always difficult to perform due to its size. However, the sap flow (SF) of the plant has been successfully measured by using the thermal dissipation probe (TDP) or ‘Granier' method in the corm of the banana plant (Lu et al. J Exp Bot 53:1771–1779, 2002). The present study aimed to validate their method using a sizable number of banana plants in a greenhouse in Israel. The SF data was compared to the gravimetric measurement of transpiration. The lag time of SF behind Tr was also analyzed. Results showed that the daily SF agreed with the daily Tr when the effective radius for sap flow in the corm was taken as 0.63 R, where R is the radius of the corm. The SF lagged 45 min behind the Tr from 0630 to 1040 hours. Whereas the Tr was not statistically (P{\textgreater}0.05) different from the SF between 1330 and 1700 hours. The reduction in water capacity of banana plant due to SF lag was about 10.5{\%} of the daily Tr, and it recovered gradually in the afternoon. Using more plants can reduce the measurement error of the TDP method. The measured daily SF can be considered as an accurate estimation of the daily Tr for banana plant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is known that most adult patients with epilepsy often have poor knowledge of their disorder, treatment options, and social and vocational consequences, despite the huge amount of information available. Being pressed for time, health care professionals often are not able to provide the repetitive counseling and instruction necessary to address epilepsy care adequately. Therefore educational programs are considered extremely important in filling the gap.

METHOD: For German-speaking countries, two educational programs called famoses, modulares Schulungsprogramm Epilepsie fur Familien [modular service package epilepsy for families], were developed by a multidisciplinary group of neuropediatricians, psychologists, social workers, and educators. The aims of the famoses programs are to improve children's and parents' knowledge about epilepsy and to help patients of childhood age and their parents achieve a better understanding of their disease, gain more self-confidence, and reduce specific fears regarding epilepsy. famoses comprises two different educational programs: famoses for kids with epilepsy within the developmental period of ages 7 to 13, and famoses for parents or caretakers. The programs are designed for interactive small-group education.

RESULTS: The child-centered educational program is based on a fictional story: The children are sailors on a virtual cruise, sailing from island to island, accompanied by educated trainers. On each island there is something new to discover about epilepsy. The parent (and caretaker)-centered educational program covers different topics-overview and content of the program, basic knowledge, diagnostics, therapy, prognosis and development, and living with epilepsy-within six modules. The program was implemented in Germany and Switzerland in the spring of 2005 and is now operating in different epilepsy centers.

CONCLUSION: Within comprehensive therapeutic management of epilepsy, educational programs for patients, and for parents (caretakers) of children with epilepsy, are considered to be extremely important. Such educational programs have two main goals: to increase knowledge about the disorder, and to strengthen the patients' responsibility for themselves, with the consequence of living with as few limitations as possible. famoses is an effective component of this comprehensive care. The program has been operating successfully in different epilepsy centers in Germany and Switzerland since the spring of 2005.},

Nine youth aged 10-15 and a parent completed several self-report measures pre- and post-intervention. Results revealed that parents did rate significant improvements in their children's coping skills following the COPE intervention. Further, compared with pre-assessment, children rated significant improvements in self-efficacy for seizure management. Child knowledge of epilepsy also significantly improved following the intervention. Two children reported mild suicidal ideation prior to the intervention, whereas no children reported ideation following the intervention.

abstract = {The heat balance method has been used successfully to measure sap flow in a number of plant species. This study was conducted to determine whether the method was applicable to coniferous seedlings, which have comparatively low rates of sap flow, and to investigate aspects of the method thought to be important at low flow rates. Flow gauges were constructed and used to measure sap flow rates in coniferous seedlings. A three-dimensional, transient, numerical model was developed to examine the effects of shortwave radiation, heat conduction along sensor leads, and transient characteristics on gauge accuracy. The model performed well and indicated that, for flow rates typical of conifers, shortwave radiation does not cause a significant error in measurement of the across-heater temperature difference ($\Delta$T). When no reflective covering was used, shortwave radiation produced orientation-dependent deviation in modeled radial temperature gradients of up to 50{\%} of the mean value. Heat conduction along thermocouple wires produced a measurement error of up to 15{\%}, which can be minimized by using small-diameter wire. Gauge accuracy is poor at low flow rates because the convective heat flux and $\Delta$T are small, and because the transient response of the gauge is slow. For coniferous seedlings, the method fails at low flow rates and measurements should be rejected when the convective heat flux is less than 5{\%} of the heater power or when $\Delta$T is small (less than 2.5°C in this study). At low flow rates, the heat storage term should be included in the heat balance. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Families who have a child with epilepsy show a significant impact on both the dynamics of the child's development and family systems in a social context. Knowledge of a family's lived experience in dealing with the early stages of their child's illness will provide a deeper understanding of their life and coping process. Most studies have focused on the child's developmental issues, parental attitudes, coping strategies and the child's adjustment. In order to assist families to cope with the early stage of having a child with epilepsy, nurses need to understand the nature of a family's lived experience.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the essence of the family health-illness transition experience from the parental perspective when a child is afflicted with epilepsy.

DESIGN: Colaizzi's phenomenological approach was used. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten couples with regard to the first one and a half years after the diagnosis of epilepsy.

SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten couples from two medical centers in Taiwan participated in the study. The age range of the children at diagnosis was 0.2-4.3 years.

METHODS: Open attitude and imaginative variation techniques were used to investigate the meanings of the experience. This study used Colaizzi's method with both destructured and restructured analysis. Lincoln and Guba's trustworthiness criteria were employed to evaluate methodological rigor.

RESULTS: Three concepts emerged: parents' psychological reactions, parental coping patterns and family resources. The parents' psychological reaction was that of being emotionally traumatized and physically exhausted. Parental coping patterns were vigilant parenting and aimed at reframing roles, facing the social challenge and assisting the child's social re-integration. The nature of family resources was family resiliency. The findings provide a scientific knowledge base for nurses when assisting parents and children during the health to illness transitional phase following a diagnosis of epilepsy.},

The device used includes a couple of thermometers in a differential connection and plate electrodes, through which a controlled heat input flows into a denned studied segment of the xylem. The present method was tested first with a laboratory simulating system, then with the stem of a living adult treePrunus avium L. The data are registered continually and automatically; continuous measurement of sap flow rate of long duration with a greater number of trees is thus made possible.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Relationships between autumn flowering, precipitation and temperature of plant species of Mediterranean coastal shrublands have been described, but not analysed experimentally. These relationships were analysed for two species of co-occurring, dominant, autumn-flowering shrubs, Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora, over 4 years and in experimentally generated drought and warming conditions. The aim was to improve predictions about the responses and adaptations of flowering of Mediterranean vegetation to climate change.

METHODS: Beginning of anthesis and date of maximum flowering intensity ('peak date') were monitored over 4 years (2001-2004) on a garrigue land type in the noth-east of the Iberian Peninsula. Two experimental treatments were applied, increased temperature (+0.73 degrees C) and reduced soil moisture (-17{\%}) relative to untreated plots.

KEY RESULTS: Flowering of Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora differed greatly between years depending on the precipitation of the previous months and the date of the last substantial rainfall ({\textgreater}10 mm). Globularia alypum flowered once or twice (unimodal or bimodal) as the result of differences in the distribution and magnitude of precipitation in late-spring and summer (when floral buds develop). The drought treatment delayed and decreased flowering of Globularia alypum in 2001 and delayed flowering in 2002. Warming extended the period between the beginning of flowering and the end of the second peak for autumn flowering in 2001 and also increased peak intensity in 2002. Flowering of Erica multiflora was unaffected by either treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: Autumn flowering of Globularia alypum and Erica multiflora is more dependent on water availability than on temperature. Considerable inter-annual plasticity in the beginning of anthesis and peak date and on unimodal or bimodal flowering constitutes a 'safe strategy' for both species in relation to varying precipitation and temperature. However, severe changes in precipitation in spring and summer may severely affect flowering of Globularia alypum but not Erica multiflora, thus affecting development/structure of the ecosystem if such conditions persist.},

abstract = {Commercially available sap flow gauges were used to evaluate the performance of the stem heat balance (SHB) technique for measuring sap flow in coffee (Coffea arabica L. cv. Yellow Catuai) and koa (Acacia koa Gray) plants under greenhouse and field conditions. Transpiration rates measured gravimetrically and with the SHB technique were similar in greenhouse tests, provided that insulation in addition to that supplied by the gauge manufacturer was applied to reduce radiant heating in the vicinity of the sap flow gauges. Unrealistic estimates of transpiration rates were sometimes obtained under both field and greenhouse conditions as a result of negative stem temperature differentials from below to above the gauge heater, even in the absence of power applied to the heaters. It was possible to correct this environmentally induced bias by means of additional stem insulation that minimized the rate of change in stem temperature, or by applying simple corrections using the DELTAT values for unheated gauges operated as blanks. In the field, where dense canopies reduced the radiant energy load on stems, temperature corrections were unnecessary, because DELTAT values in unheated gauges were near zero.},

abstract = {Sap flow measurement techniques, such as the heat pulse (compensation) method, are practical means for estimating the water use of individual trees and are often the only reasonable alternative for measuring forest and woodland transpiration in complex heterogeneous terrain. The need to scale estimates of water use from a sample of individual stems to a stand (population) of known area may be satisfied by applying scalars of flux based on tree size or domain. We estimated the aggregate errors in applying the heat pulse technique to the estimation of stand transpiration in a poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea F.J. Muell.) woodland in southeastern Queensland, Australia, by a combination of precision analyses, experimental validation and Monte Carlo simulations of sampling errors. Errors in sap flux density measurements were approximately 13{\%}. The potential error in the flux estimates for individual stems with stratified sampling of sap flux density with depth and bole quadrant based on four sensors was an additional 25{\%}. Conducting wood area, diameter at 1.3 m, leaf area and domain based on Ecological Field Theory all proved excellent scalars of flux at the stand level. With a sample size of six trees stratified by diameter, coefficients of variation in scaling to the stand level were approximately 5{\%} for any of these scalars. The greatest potential source of error in estimating stand transpiration by the heat pulse method was in the measurement of the fluxes of individual stems; scaling these measurements to a homogeneous stand of trees involved less uncertainty.},

abstract = {Gamma-oryzanol, a phytosteryl ferulate mixture extracted from rice bran oil, has a wide spectrum of biological activities; in particular, it has antioxidant properties and is often used in cosmetic formulations as a sunscreen. The first objective of the present investigation was to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) of the antioxidant activity of gamma-oryzanol by utilising different in vitro model systems, such as scavenging of stable DPPH radical, OH and O2- radicals scavenging, and azocompound AMVN-initiated lipid peroxidation. The effect of gamma-oryzanol on the oxidative stability of vegetable oils of pharmaceutical and cosmetic interest was then evaluated in a oxidation accelerate test and compared with the effect of the well-known antioxidants BHA and BHT. Our results demonstrate that gamma-oryzanol is an organic radical scavenger able to prevent AMVN-triggered lipoperoxidation. Moreover, when added to oils at concentrations ranging between 2.5 and 10 mmol/kg, gamma-oryzanol shows a dose-dependent increase of the induction times; in particular, it improved the oxidative stability of oils very prone to lipoperoxidation because of their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. On the ground of our results, we can conclude that gamma-oryzanol may have a potential application for the stabilization of lipidic raw materials.},

abstract = {Heat-based sap flux density (SFD) methods have been widely used to estimate the water use by conifers, but complexities arise due to the heterogeneous nature of conifer sapwood with annual rings of earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW), which differ in water- and heat-conducting properties. Laboratory-based controlled flow experiments using freshly cut stem segments from 11 pine trees were undertaken to evaluate the potential impact of hydraulic architecture of conifer sapwood on tree water use estimates from the Heat Ratio Method (HRM) and Heat Field Deformation (HFD) method, by considering different scenarios regarding the hydraulic conductivity and thermal diffusivity of EW and LW. The results show that the actual water flux was systematically underestimated in Scenario 1 (assuming only EW was water-conductive but thermal diffusivity was mean of EW and LW) and Scenario 3 (assuming equal hydraulic conductivity of LW and EW but thermal diffusivity was that of only EW). However, the mean sap flux densities obtained from 11 sample trees after correction by the LW/EW ratios were pretty close to the gravimetrical flow. Assuming equal hydraulic conductivity of LW and EW and mean thermal diffusivity of EW and LW led to either overestimation or underestimation of water use by individual trees, but the mean tree-scale water use was unbiased when including all this variance in the study system. The observed heterogeneous radial SFD variability from the HFD measurements was closely linked with patterns of successive EW and LW, especially in the central parts of the sapwood where higher SFD values were generally observed. The decreasing SFD patterns towards the cambium and heartwood were partially attributed to the decrease in moisture content, tracheid diameter and the increase in wood density of EW and LW compared with the central sapwood. The results indicated that the LW/EW ratio in stems where sap flow probes have been inserted can be measured a posteriori to correct HRM-based sap flow measurements. The sap flux is recommended to be radially corrected using the SFD patterns from HFD sensors measured at the same location of the HRM measurements in the same tree.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: 'Pollination syndromes' are suites of phenotypic traits hypothesized to reflect convergent adaptations of flowers for pollination by specific types of animals. They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant-pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.

METHODS: Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.

KEY RESULTS: Ordination of flowers in a multivariate 'phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space.

CONCLUSIONS: The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.},

However, it is unclear whether there are strong patterns in terms of their major effects, how the vulnerability of different ecosystems varies and which ecosystem services are at greatest risk. We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.},

abstract = {Flower colour is an important signal used by flowering plants to attract pollinators. Many anthophilous insects have an innate colour preference that is displayed during their first foraging bouts and which could help them locate their first nectar reward. Nevertheless, learning capabilities allow insects to switch their colour preferences with experience and thus, to track variation in floral nectar availability. Manduca sexta, a crepuscular hawkmoth widely studied as a model system for sensory physiology and behaviour, visits mostly white, night-blooming flowers lacking UV reflectance throughout its range in the Americas. Nevertheless, the spectral sensitivity of the feeding behaviour of na{\"{i}}ve moths shows a narrow peak around 450 nm wavelengths, suggesting an innate preference for the colour blue. Under more natural conditions (i.e. broader wavelength reflectance) than in previous studies, we used dual choice experiments with blue- and white-coloured feeders to investigate the innate preference of na{\"{i}}ve moths and trained different groups to each colour to evaluate their learning capabilities. We confirmed the innate preference of M. sexta for blue and found that these moths were able to switch colour preferences after training experience.

abstract = {In order to evaluate the influence of canopy cover and leaf area on the water use of short rotation coppices (SRC), we measured evapotranspiration and transpiration of a young and a full-grown mature poplar SRC throughout one growing season, using the Bowen-ratio energy balance method and sap flux technique, respectively. The young SRC at Fuhrberg had a sparse though developing canopy reaching a maximum leaf area index (LAI) of 3.8m2m-2 in August, while the mature SRC at Gro{\ss}fahner earlier reached maximum LAI at 7.4m2m-2. Despite contrasting canopy densities, growing season total evapotranspiration (Fuhrberg: 380mm, Gro{\ss}fahner: 445mm) and transpiration ratios did not differ substantially, because understorey transpiration and soil evaporation probably compensated low tree transpiration in the first half of the growing season at LAI{\textless}3m2m-2. Mid-season mean daily transpiration on rainless days was 2.34±0.13mmd-1 at Fuhrberg and 3.16±0.81 at Gro{\ss}fahner. The values for the full-grown SRC at Gro{\ss}fahner were in the middle range of reported values for poplar SRCs of comparable LAI and canopy density, and came from efficient stomatal regulation of transpiration, in which poplar clones might differ. Bulk canopy conductance (gc), calculated by inverting the Penman-Monteith equation and related to vapor pressure deficit (D), revealed stomatal control of transpiration at the mature plantation, and according to a simple hydraulic model, was sufficient to maintain a minimum leaf water potential at high atmospheric demand. This indicated isohydric behavior and marks a conservative water use strategy, which avoids water stress by limiting transpiration rates at high D and might be typical for the investigated poplar hybrid (J-105). The young plantation exhibited a similar water use strategy, when LAI was above 3m2m-2. Before canopy closure, the ratio of stomatal sensitivity (m) and reference conductance (gcref, i.e. gc at D=1kPa), which are parameters of a logarithmical response curve of gc to D, was significantly lower than the theoretical ratio for isohydric responses. This indicates poor stomatal control of water loss and reflected the contribution of understorey-transpiration and soil evaporation to total stand evapotranspiration, which might increase severely at high evaporative demand in sparse poplar stands. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A laboratory test and field evaluation were conducted to determine the accuracy of the three commonly used techniques for measuring sap flux density in trees: heat pulse velocity, thermal dissipation and heat field deformation. In the laboratory test a constant flow rate of water was maintained through freshly cut stem segments of diffuse-porous Fagus grandifolia trees with mean sapwood depths of 4.02??0.14 and 7.44??0.51cm for sample trees with stem diameter at breast height of 15 and 21cm, respectively. The three sensor types were measured simultaneously and compared against gravimetric measurements. All three techniques substantially underestimated sap flux density. On average the actual sap flux density was underestimated by 35{\%} using heat pulse velocity (with wound correction), 46{\%} using heat field deformation and 60{\%} using thermal dissipation. These results were consistent across sap flux densities ranging from 5 to 80cm3cm-2h-1. Heat pulse velocity measurements were more variable than those of the other two techniques, and the least accurate at low sap flux densities. An error analysis was conducted on all parameters of the equations used with each technique. That analysis indicated that each technique has unique sensitivities to errors in parameter estimates which need to be taken into consideration. Except for the use of heat, the three techniques are quite different and there appeared to be no single reason why the methods underestimated actual sap flux density, but rather there were likely multiple errors that compounded to reduce the overall accuracy of each technique. Field measurements supported the relative sensor performance observed in the laboratory. Applying a sensor-specific correction factor based on the laboratory test to the field data produced similar estimates of sap flux density from all three techniques. We conclude that a species-specific calibration is necessary when using any of these techniques to insure that accurate estimates of sap flux density are obtained, at least until a physical basis for an error correction can be proposed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phenology affects nearly all aspects of ecology and evolution. Virtually all biological phenomena—from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes—have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

abstract = {Human skin is exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation damages human skin and results in an old and wrinkled appearance, called photoaging. We have previously reported that molecular mechanisms by which ultraviolet light causes photoaging involve activation of growth factor and cytokine receptors in keratinocytes and dermal cells. They lead to downstream signal transduction through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-jun N-terminal protein kinase, and p38) pathways. These signaling pathways converge in the nucleus of cells to form an activated complex of transcription factor activator protein 1 (cFos/cJun), which induces matrix metalloproteinases that degrade skin connective tissue. In addition to cell surface receptor activation, generation of reactive oxygen species by ultraviolet radiation is believed to be critical in triggering mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We investigated the ability of (i) ultraviolet irradiation to generate reactive oxygen species in human skin in vivo; and (ii) genistein, which possesses both tyrosine kinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities, and n-acetyl cysteine, which can be converted into the endogenous antioxidant glutathione, to impair responses to ultraviolet light that eventuate in photoaging in human skin in vivo. Ultraviolet irradiation caused a rapid and significant increase in hydrogen peroxide levels in human skin in vivo. Pretreatment of human skin with genistein inhibited ultraviolet-induced epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity, whereas n-acetyl cysteine did not. Genistein inhibited ultraviolet induction of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cJun N-terminal protein kinase activities. n-Acetyl cysteine inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase but not cJun N-terminal protein kinase activation. Both genistein and n-acetyl cysteine prevented ultraviolet induction of cJun protein. Consistent with this, genistein and n-acetyl cysteine blocked ultraviolet induction of cJun-driven enzyme, collagenase. Neither genistein nor n-acetyl cysteine acted as sunscreens as they had no effect on ultraviolet-induced erythema. These data indicate that compounds similar to genistein and n-acetyl cysteine, which possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory and/or antioxidant activities, may prevent photoaging.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is widely expected to drive species extinct by hampering individual survival and reproduction, by reducing the amount and accessibility of suitable habitat, or by eliminating other organisms that are essential to the species in question. Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO(2). Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17-50{\%} of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},

Baseliner enables users to QA/QC data and process data using a combination of automated steps, visualization, and manual editing. Data processing requires establishing a zero-flow reference value, or “baseline”, which varies among sensors and with time. Since no set of algorithms currently exists to reliably QA/QC and estimate the zero-flow baseline, Baseliner provides a graphical user interface to allow visual inspection and manipulation of data. Data are first automatically processed using a set of user defined parameters. The user can then view the data for additional, manual QA/QC and baseline identification using mouse and keyboard commands. The open-source software allows for user customization of data processing algorithms as improved methods are developed.},

Control plants were daily irrigated at field capacity. Values of sap flow (SF) were compared with transpiration (E) rates measured gravimetrically. The results underlined the robustness and high sensitivity of the compensation heat-pulse technique for estimating transpiration on a wide range of SF. Good direct correlations between E and SF rates on an instantaneous and daily basis were obtained in both treatments. On a daily basis, a common calibration curve can be used for both irrigation treatments. On an instantaneous basis, changes in SF were matches by similar changes in E in both treatments, although the relationships between these parameters presented different intercepts in each treatment. Sap flow rates were influenced by weather conditions in trees growing in non-limiting soil water conditions. This makes it possible to evaluate the significance of any sap flow measurement in relation to the reference value calculated for the vapour pressure deficit at the time the measurement was taken.},

Previously reported global mean T/(E + T + I) from multiple independent sources, including satellite-based estimations, reanalysis, land surface models, and isotopic measurements, varies substantially from 24{\%} to 90{\%}. Here we develop a new ET partitioning algorithm, which combines global evapotranspiration estimates and relationships between leaf area index (LAI) and T/(E + T) for different vegetation types, to upscale a wide range of published site-scale measurements. We show that transpiration accounts for about 57.2{\%} (with standard deviation ± 6.8{\%}) of global terrestrial ET. Our approach bridges the scale gap between site measurements and global model simulations,and can be simply implemented into current global climate models to improve biological CO2 flux simulations.},

abstract = {Flowering plants in Australia have been geographically isolated for more than 34 million years. In the Northern Hemisphere, previous work has revealed a close fit between the optimal discrimination capabilities of hymenopteran pollinators and the flower colours that have most frequently evolved. We collected spectral data from 111 Australian native flowers and tested signal appearance considering the colour discrimination capabilities of potentially important pollinators. The highest frequency of flower reflectance curves is consistent with data reported for the Northern Hemisphere. The subsequent mapping of Australian flower reflectances into a bee colour space reveals a very similar distribution of flower colour evolution to the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning. This observation suggests a requirement for plasticity in the nervous systems of pollinators to allow generalization of flowers of the same species while overcoming the possible presence of non-rewarding flower mimics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the main etiologic factor for skin cancer. The endogenous hormone melatonin has been proposed to have protective effects against sunlight.

AIM: The aim of this review was to evaluate melatonin's protective effects against UV radiation and to clarify the cellular mechanisms behind this effect.

METHOD: Medline, Embase and Cinahl were searched up to January 2013 to identify studies evaluating melatonin's protective effect against UV radiation (UVR)-induced skin erythema in humans and damage on a cellular level.

RESULTS: Four human studies have investigated melatonin's protective effect on UVR-induced skin damage. Melatonin was shown to have protective effects when applied before UVR, but no effect if applied after exposure. A total of 16 experimental studies evaluated melatonin's protective effect against UVR-induced damage to cellular structures and pathways.

DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The protection against UVR-induced skin damage was conducted by melatonin acting directly as an antioxidant, and indirectly by regulating gene expression and inducing a DNA stabilizing effect. As these results were obtained using artificial UVR and without investigating possible side effects, studies using natural sunlight and evaluating possible side effects of topical melatonin administration are warranted.},

RESULTS: Of 249 eligible participants enrolled, 92 individuals completed both surveys. Over 6 weeks, completers improved their epilepsy self-management (ESMS total score from 139.7 to 142.7, p = 0.02) and epilepsy self-efficacy (ESES total score from 244.2 to 254.4, p = 0.02) scores, with greatest impact on an information management subscale (ESMS-information management total score from 20.3 to 22.4, p {\textless} 0.001). Results were similar in intention-to-treat analyses. Median number of logins, postings to forums, leaving profile comments, and sending private messages were more common in completers than noncompleters.

CONCLUSIONS: An internet-based psychosocial intervention was feasible to implement in the US veteran population and increased epilepsy self-management and self-efficacy scores. The greatest improvement was noted for information management behaviors. Patients with chronic conditions are increasingly encouraged to self-manage their condition, and digital communities have potential advantages, such as convenience, scalability to large populations, and building a community support network.

CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with epilepsy, engaging in an online patient community improves self-management and self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Bamboos are grasses (Poaceae) that are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. We aimed at exploring water use patterns of four tropical bamboo species (Bambusa vulgaris, Dendrocalamus asper, Gigantochloa atroviolacea, and G. apus) with sap flux measurement techniques. Our approach included three experimental steps: (1) a pot experiment with a comparison of thermal dissipation probes (TDPs), the stem heat balance (SHB) method and gravimetric readings using potted B. vulgaris culms, (2) an in situ calibration of TDPs with the SHB method for the four bamboo species, and (3) field monitoring of sap flux of the four bamboo species along with three tropical tree species (Gmelina arborea, Shorea leprosula, and Hevea brasiliensis) during a dry and a wet period. In the pot experiment, it was confirmed that the SHB method is well suited for bamboos but that TDPs need to be calibrated. In situ, species-specific parameters for such calibration formulas were derived. During field monitoring we found that some bamboo species reached high maximum sap flux densities. Across bamboo species, maximal sap flux density increased with decreasing culm diameter. In the diurnal course, sap flux densities in bamboos peaked much earlier than radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and also much earlier than sap flux densities in trees. There was a pronounced hysteresis between sap flux density and VPD in bamboos, which was less pronounced in trees. Three of the four bamboo species showed reduced sap flux densities at high VPD values during the dry period, which was associated with a decrease in soil moisture content. Possible roles of internal water storage, root pressure and stomatal sensitivity are discussed.},

abstract = {Melatonin, one of the evolutionarily most ancient, highly conserved and most pleiotropic hormones still operative in man, couples complex tissue functions to defined changes in the environment. Showing photoperiod-associated changes in its activity levels in mammals, melatonin regulates, chronobiological and reproductive systems, coat phenotype and mammary gland functions. However, this chief secretory product of the pineal gland is now recognized to also exert numerous additional functions which range from free radical scavenging and DNA repair via immunomodulation, body weight control and the promotion of wound healing to the coupling of environmental cues to circadian clock gene expression and the modulation of secondary endocrine signalling (e.g. prolactin release, oestrogen receptor-mediated signalling). Some of these activities are mediated by high-affinity membrane (MT1, MT2) or specific cytosolic (MT3/NQO2) and nuclear hormone receptors (ROR alpha), while others reflect receptor-independent antioxidant activities of melatonin. Recently, it was shown that mammalian (including human) skin and hair follicles are not only melatonin targets, but also sites of extrapineal melatonin synthesis. Therefore, we provide here an update of the relevant cutaneous effects and mechanisms of melatonin, portray melatonin as a major skin protectant and sketch how its multi-facetted functions may impact on skin biology and pathology. This is illustrated by focussing on recent findings on the role of melatonin in photodermatology and hair follicle biology. After listing a number of key open questions, we conclude by defining particularly important, clinically relevant perspectives for how melatonin may become therapeutically exploitable in cutaneous medicine.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present the development, contents and efficacy of the FLIP{\&}FLAP programme for children and adolescents with epilepsy, and their parents.

INTERVENTION: The programme is mainly directed at age-appropriately developed children and adolescents between 6 and 16 who take antiepileptic drugs. It is conducted as a 2.5-day group training programme; children and parents are grouped separately. The main focuses are: EVALUATION STUDY: We performed a multi-centre non-randomised two-group pre-/post-trial using a waiting-list control group design. 10 German epilepsy centres participated. The intervention group, IG (21 children 8-11 years, 44 adolescents 12-16 years, 72 parents) completed standardised questionnaires immediately before the FLIP{\&}FLAP course and 6 months later; the waiting control group, WCG (31 children, 39 adolescents, 72 parents) 6 months before and immediately before the course. Compared to the WCG, the children and parents of the IG showed significantly improved knowledge of epilepsy, with medium to large effect sizes (univariate analysis of variance with repeated measurements, d=0.6-1.4). Parents of the IG reported improved self-management skills (d=0.7) and communication skills (d=0.8) of their child and fewer epilepsy-related worries (d=0.5). Children and adolescents of the IG reported improved HRQOL in the Social Exclusion dimension (d=0.3).

CONCLUSION: FLIP{\&}FLAP is an effective child- and family-centred programme. It is currently being established in Northern Germany to test its usefulness in routine care.},

abstract = {The thermal dissipation method is simple and widely used for measuring sap flow in large stems. As with several other thermal methods, natural temperature gradients are assumed to be negligible in the sapwood being measured. We studied the magnitude and variability of natural temperature gradients in sapwood of Acacia trees growing in the Sahelian zone of Senegal, analyzed their effects on sap flow measurements, and investigated possible solutions. A new measurement approach employing cyclic heating (45 minutes of heating and 15 minutes of cooling; 45/15) was also tested. Three-day measurement sequences that included 1 day without heating, a second day with continuous heating and a third day with cyclic heating were recorded during a 6.5-month period using probes installed at three azimuths in a tree trunk. Natural temperature gradients between the two probes of the sensor unit, spaced 8 to 10 cm vertically, were rarely negligible (i.e., {\textless} 0.2 degrees C): they were positive during the night and negative during the day, with an amplitude ranging from 0.3 to 3.5 degrees C depending on trunk azimuth, day and season. These temperature gradients had a direct influence on the signal from the continuously heated sensors, inducing fluctuations in the nighttime reference signal. The resulting errors in sap flow estimates can be greater than 100{\%}. Correction protocols have been proposed in previous studies, but they were unsuitable because of the high spatial and temporal variability of the natural temperature gradients. We found that a measurement signal derived from a noncontinuous heating system could be an attractive solution because it appears to be independent of natural temperature gradients. The magnitude and variability of temperature gradients that we observed were likely exacerbated by the combination of open stand, high solar radiation and low sap flow rate. However, for all applications of the thermal dissipation method, it is wise to check regularly for natural temperature gradients by switching off the heater.},

abstract = {Carica papaya L. does not contain wood, according to the botanical definition of wood as lignified secondary xylem. Despite its parenchymatous secondary xylem, these plants are able to grow up to 10-m high. This is surprising, as wooden structural elements are the ubiquitous strategy for supporting height growth in plants. Proposed possible alternative principles to explain the compensation for lack of wood in C. papaya are turgor pressure of the parenchyma, lignified phloem fibres in the bark, or a combination of the two. Interestingly, lignified tissue comprises only 5-8{\%} of the entire stem mass. Furthermore, the phloem fibres do not form a compact tube enclosing the xylem, but instead form a mesh tubular structure. To investigate the mechanism of papaya's unusually high mechanical strength, a set of mechanical measurements were undertaken on whole stems and tissue sections of secondary phloem and xylem. The structural Young's modulus of mature stems reached 2.5 GPa. Since this is low compared to woody plants, the flexural rigidity of papaya stem construction may mainly be based on a higher second moment of inertia. Additionally, stem turgor pressure was determined indirectly by immersing specimens in sucrose solutions of different osmolalities, followed by mechanical tests; turgor pressure was between 0.82 and 1.25 MPa, indicating that turgor is essential for flexural rigidity of the entire stem.},

abstract = {Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and tropospheric ozone (O-3) have the potential to affect tree physiology and structure, and hence forest feedbacks on climate. Here, we investigated how elevated concentrations of CO2 (+ 45{\%}) and O-3 (+ 35{\%}), alone and in combination, affected conductance for mass transfer at the leaf and canopy levels in pure aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixed aspen and birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) forests in the free-air CO2-O-3 enrichment experiment near Rhinelander, Wisconsin (Aspen FACE). The study was conducted during two growing seasons, when steady-state leaf area index (L) had been reached after {\textgreater} 6 years of exposure to CO2- and O-3-enrichment treatments. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was estimated from stand sap flux, while leaf-level conductance of sun leaves in the upper canopy was derived by three different and independent methods: sap flux and L in combination with vertical canopy modelling, leaf C-13 discrimination methodology in combination with photosynthesis modelling and leaf-level gas exchange. Regardless of the method used, the mean values of leaf-level conductance were higher in trees growing under elevated CO2 and/or O-3 than in trees growing in control plots, causing a CO2 x O-3 interaction that was statistically significant (P {\textless}= 0.10) for sap flux-and (for birch) C-13-derived leaf conductance. Canopy conductance was significantly increased by elevated CO2 but not significantly affected by elevated O-3. Investigation of a short-term gap in CO2 enrichment demonstrated a + 10{\%} effect of transient exposure of elevated CO2-grown trees to ambient CO2 on g(c). All treatment effects were similar in pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch communities. These results demonstrate that short-term primary stomatal closure responses to elevated CO2 and O-3 were completely offset by long-term cumulative effects of these trace gases on tree and stand structure in determining canopy- and leaf-level conductance in pure aspen and mixed aspen-birch forests. Our results, together with the findings from other long-term FACE experiments with trees, suggest that model assumptions of large reductions in stomatal conductance under rising atmospheric CO2 are very uncertain for forests.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe the pain and explain the possible association among demographics, psychological and biological variables of the patients subjected to heart surgery with pain intensity during the postoperative in the ICU. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A descriptive, longitudinal study conducted between February 2008 and January 2009 on patients subjected to heart surgery with admission to the ICU of the Hospital of Navarra was conducted. A preoperatory interview was made with registration of sociodemographic, biological and psychological variables. Pain intensity was monitored during the first 48 hours of ICU stay with the Verbal Numeric Scale (VNS) of pain. Accepted level of significance was p{\textless}0.05. RESULTS: A sample of 69 patients with mean age of 62, 26{\%} women and 74{\%} men was included. A superior statistical association was found between postoperative pain levels for age{\textless}65 years, bypass grafting with internal mammary artery and preoperatory anxiety variables. There was a significant increase in analgesic consumption for incomes{\textgreater}1400 €/month, bypass grafting with internal mammary artery and preoperatory anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pain after heart surgery show significant individual variability. In our study, age, bypass grafting with internal mammary artery and preoperatory anxiety were shown as predictive variables of postoperative pain in patients undergoing heart surgery.},

Timings were compared to Central England temperatures and all 25 phenological events were significantly related (P{\textless}0.001 in all but 1 case) to temperature. These findings are discussed in relation to other published work. The conclusions drawn from this work are that timings of spring and summer species will get progressively earlier as the climate warms, but that the lower limit for a flowering date is probably best determined by examining species phenology at the southern limit of their distribution.},

abstract = {Understanding the effects of landscape heterogeneity on spatial genetic variation is a primary goal of landscape genetics. Ecological and geographic variables can contribute to genetic structure through geographic isolation, in which geographic barriers and distances restrict gene flow, and ecological isolation, in which gene flow among populations inhabiting different environments is limited by selection against dispersers moving between them. Although methods have been developed to study geographic isolation in detail, ecological isolation has received much less attention, partly because disentangling the effects of these mechanisms is inherently difficult. Here, I describe a novel approach for quantifying the effects of geographic and ecological isolation using multiple matrix regression with randomization. I explored the parameter space over which this method is effective using a series of individual-based simulations and found that it accurately describes the effects of geographic and ecological isolation over a wide range of conditions. I also applied this method to a set of real-world datasets to show that ecological isolation is an often overlooked but important contributor to patterns of spatial genetic variation and to demonstrate how this analysis can provide new insights into how landscapes contribute to the evolution of genetic variation in nature.},

abstract = {Transpiration is a significant component of the hydrologic cycle and its accurate quantification is critical for modelling, industry, and policy decisions. Sap flow sensors provide a low cost and practical method to measure transpiration. Various methods to measure sap flow are available and a popular family of methods is known as heat pulse velocity (HPV). Theory on thermal conductance and convection, that underpins HPV methods, suggests transpiration can be directly estimated from sensor measurements without the need for laborious calibrations. To test this accuracy, transpiration estimated from HPV sensors is compared with an independent measure of plant water use such as a weighing lysimeter. A meta-analysis of the literature that explicitly tested the accuracy of a HPV sensors against an independent measure of transpiration was conducted. Data from linear regression analysis was collated where an R2 of 1 indicates perfect precision and a slope of 1 of the linear regression curve indicates perfect accuracy. The average R2 and slope from all studies was 0.822 and 0.860, respectively. However, the overall error, or deviation from real transpiration values, was 34.706{\%}. The results indicate that HPV sensors are precise in correlating heat velocity with rates of transpiration, but poor in quantifying transpiration. Various sources of error in converting heat velocity into sap velocity and sap flow are discussed including probe misalignment, wound corrections, thermal diffusivity, stem water content, placement of sensors in sapwood, and scaling of point measurements to whole plants. Where whole plant water use or transpiration is required in a study, it is recommended that all sap flow sensors are calibrated against an independent measure of transpiration.},

abstract = {Transient simultaneous measurements of thermal conductivity and diffusivity of Swedish wood have been performed with the plane source technique on oven-dry hardwood (birch) samples at room temperature and at 100 OC. The influences of temperature, density, porosity and anisotropy on thermal conduction were investigated. The measurements were done in longitudinal (parallel to the grain) and transverse (intermediate between radial and tangential) directions. As the temperature increased from 20 to 100 °C, the thermal conductivity of each sample increased shghtly for both longitudinal and transverse directions. The effect of density and porosity on the thermal conductivity may be related to the presence of other scattering mechanisms such as voids and cell boundaries. It seems that the dominant mechanism of heat transfer across the cell lumina in these types of wood is the heat conduction through the voids. An attempt was made to explain the behaviour of the effective thermal conductivity by adopting a model based on the ratio between heat conduction in parallel and serial layers of gas, liquid, and solid phases.},

abstract = {Pollination network studies are based on pollinator surveys conducted on focal plants. This plant-centred approach provides insufficient information on flower visitation habits of rare pollinator species, which are the majority in pollinator communities. As a result, pollination networks contain very high proportions of pollinator species linked to a single plant species (extreme specialists), a pattern that contrasts with the widely accepted view that plant-pollinator interactions are mostly generalized. In this study of a Mediterranean scrubland community in NE Spain we supplement data from an intensive field survey with the analysis of pollen loads carried by pollinators. We observed 4265 contacts corresponding to 19 plant and 122 pollinator species. The addition of pollen data unveiled a very significant number of interactions, resulting in important network structural changes. Connectance increased 1.43-fold, mean plant connectivity went from 18.5 to 26.4, and mean pollinator connectivity from 2.9 to 4.1. Extreme specialist pollinator species decreased 0.6-fold, suggesting that ecological specialization is often overestimated in plant-pollinator networks. We expected a greater connectivity increase in rare species, and consequently a decrease in the level of asymmetric specialization. However, new links preferentially attached to already highly connected nodes and, as a result, both nestedness and centralization increased. The addition of pollen data revealed the existence of four clearly defined modules that were not apparent when only field survey data were used. Three of these modules had a strong phenological component. In comparison to other pollination webs, our network had a high proportion of connector links and species. That is, although significant, the four modules were far from isolated.},

The photoprotective effect of C. chinensis and P. amurense glycan against UV-induced oxidative damage was also investigated in skin. At the concentration range employed, the two glycans showed strong free radical scavenging activity. Ultraviolet radiation reduced skin antioxidant enzyme and immunity activities in animals. Administration of C. chinensis and P. amurense glycans dose-dependently significantly increased skin antioxidant enzyme and immunity activities in animals.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: •

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Community-level flowering patterns can be characterized by onset, duration, and end as well as constancy, the degree to which species commence, cease, and reinitiate flowering within a season. In the mountainous Sky Islands region of the southwestern United States, flowering onset is clearly influenced by elevation in the spring, but much less so in the summer season. We evaluated whether these flowering metrics reflect these dissimilar patterns between distinct spring and summer seasons regarding the influence of the elevation and moisture gradient. •

METHODS: We characterized flowering onset, end, duration, and constancy by plant functional type and their relationships to climate variables in spring and summer. We also evaluated the influence of climate on seasonal flowering patterns. •

KEY RESULTS: Gaps in seasonal flowering occur frequently in this system in both seasons and among all plant functional types. In both seasons, annual plants exhibit the shortest flowering durations and highest constancies, and plants at low elevations, inhabiting environments with variable moisture conditions, show a greater tendency for longer flowering durations and lower constancy than high-elevation plants. Spring flowering characteristics are most influenced by the total amount of October-March precipitation as well as temperatures in these months, whereas summer flowering characteristics are influenced by the timing of summer-season precipitation, and next by the total amount of summer precipitation. •

CONCLUSIONS: Flowering metrics, especially constancy and duration, show similar patterns in spring and summer and vary across elevation and moisture gradients. These patterns have substantial implications for plant and animal communities.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal patterns of snowmelt and flowering times affect fruiting success in Erythronium grandiflorum Pursh (Liliaceae) in subalpine western Colorado, USA. From 1990 to 1995, I measured the consistency across years of snowmelt patterns and flowering times along a permanent transect. In most years since 1993, I have monitored fruit set in temporal cohorts (early- to late-flowering groups of plants) at one site. To assess 'pollination limitation', I have also conducted supplemental hand-pollination experiments at various times through the blooming season. The onset of blooming is determined by snowmelt, with the earliest years starting a month before the latest years owing to variation in winter snowpack accumulation. Fruit set is diminished or prevented entirely by killing frosts in some years, most frequently but not exclusively for the earlier cohorts. When frosts do not limit fruit set, pollination limitation is frequent, especially in the earlier cohorts. Pollination limitation is strongest for middle cohorts: it tends to be negated by frost in early cohorts and ameliorated by continuing emergence of bumble-bee queens in later cohorts. This lily appears to be poorly synchronized with its pollinators. Across the years of the study, pollination limitation appears to be increasing, perhaps because the synchronization is getting worse.},

abstract = {In a unique phenomenon restricted to the ever wet forests of Southeast Asia, hundreds of species from dozens of plant families reproduce synchronously at irregular, multi-year intervals. The proximate environmental cues that synchronize these general flowering events have not been evaluated systematically because there have been no long-term, high temporal resolution, species-level records from the region. We present 13 years of weekly flowering records for five Shorea species as well as daily temperature and rainfall records from the Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. We constructed models to evaluate hypothesized relationships between flowering and cool temperature, drought, and additive and synergistic effects of cool temperature and drought for each species. Model parameters include periods of time for floral cue accumulation and flower development and temperature and/or rainfall thresholds required for floral initiation. Parameters estimated using flowering observations from 2001 to 2011 were used to forecast flowering for 2011–2014. We show that drought and cool temperatures acting synergistically best explain the timing of flowering events for all Shorea species in the section Mutica and forecast the largest general flowering event accurately. Periods estimated for signal accumulation ranged from 54 to 90 days among species. Periods estimated for flowers to develop ranged between 43 and 96 days and closely followed the interspecific sequence of flowering in the Shorea species. Drought and temperature thresholds also varied among species, with Shorea maxwelliana requiring the most severe drought and Shorea leprosula the lowest temperatures. Synthesis. Our results indicate that cool temperatures and low rainfall occurring on seasonal time-scales of about 2–3 months rather than brief cold snaps or brief droughts best explain general flowering in Shorea species at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. Low rainfall is equally likely in winter (December–February) and summer (July–August) and cool temperatures are most likely in winter at Pasoh, which explains why general flowering events are restricted to spring and fall, with more frequent and stronger flowering in spring. In addition, species-specific sensitivity to environmental cues suggests that future climate change will have differential impacts on the frequency of reproduction, with potential consequences for regeneration of these dominant species of lowland tropical forests.},

abstract = {Granier style thermal dissipation probes (TDPs) have been used to estimate whole plant water use on a variety of tree and vine species. However, studies using TDPs and load cells (gravimetric water loss) to estimate water use of landscape tree species are rare. This research compared gravimetric water loss (estimated with load cells) of four containerized landscape tree species with water loss estimated with TDPs. Over a 66 day period, an experiment compared water loss of three established, 5.0 cm (2 in) caliper poplar (Populus nigra ‘Italica') trees in 75-liter (20 gal) containers on load cells to TDP estimated water loss. Each tree had a single 30 mm (1.2 inch) TDP inserted into the trunk at four heights above soil level (15, 30, 45, and 60 cm (6, 12, 18, and 24 in, respectively)). Data revealed TDP estimated water loss was less than load cell estimated water loss regardless of TDP height, but TDP estimated water loss at the 30 cm height was closest to actual load cell estimated tree water loss. Over the next three years, similar sized Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana ‘Bradford'), English oak (Quercus robur x Q. bicolor ‘Asjes'), poplar (Populus deltoides ‘Siouxland'), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua ‘Rotundiloba') trees in containers were placed on load cells and one 30 mm TDP was placed into the trunk of each tree 30 cm above soil level. Over an extended time period, tree water loss was estimated using load cells and TDPs. Hourly TDP water loss estimates for each species over a three day period indicate TDP estimated water loss followed similar trends as load cell estimated water loss. However, TDP estimates were generally less than load cell estimates, especially during peak transpiration periods. For each species, mean total daily water loss estimates were less for TDP estimated water loss when compared to load cell estimated water loss. Although TDP estimated water loss has been correlated with actual tree water loss for many species, these data suggest errors may arise when using TDPs to estimate water loss of small, containerized landscape tree species.},

abstract = {Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, a complete environmental carcinogen, induces oxidative and inflammatory skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of skin carcinogenesis. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of a wide variety of plant polyphenols have been reported. Rutin (3-rhamnosyl-glucosylquercetin), a polyphenol present in many edible plants, possesses diverse pharmacological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and anticancer activities. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of rutin on UVB-induced inflammation in mouse skin in vivo. Topical application of rutin onto the dorsal skin of female HR-1 hairless mice 30 min prior to UVB irradiation diminished epidermal hyperplasia and the levels of proteins modified by 4-hydroxynonenal, which is a biochemical hallmark of lipid peroxidation. Topical application of rutin also significantly inhibited UVB-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), two representative inflammatory enzymes, in hairless mouse skin. Rutin inhibited the DNA binding of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in mouse skin exposed to UVB. Moreover, rutin attenuated UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAP kinase and JNK decreased UVB-induced expression of COX-2 in mouse skin. Taken together, these findings suggest that rutin exerts anti-inflammatory effects in UVB-irradiated mouse skin by inhibiting expression of COX-2 and iNOS, which is attributable to its suppression of p38 MAP kinase and JNK signaling responsible for AP-1 activation.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants are flowering earlier in response to climate change. However, substantial interannual variation in phenology may make it difficult to discern and compare long-term trends. In addition to providing insight on data requirements for discerning such trends, phenological shifts within subsets of long-term records will provide insight into the mechanisms driving changes in flowering over longer time scales.

METHODS: To examine variation in flowering shifts among temporal subsets of long-term records, we used two data sets of flowering phenology from snow-dominated habitats: subalpine meadow in Gothic, Colorado, USA (38 yr), and arctic tundra in Zackenberg, Greenland (16 yr). Shifts in flowering time were calculated as 10-yr moving averages for onset, peak, and end of flowering.

KEY RESULTS: Flowering advanced over the course of the entire time series at both sites. Flowering shifts at Gothic were variable, with some 10-yr time frames showing significant delays and others significant advancements. Early-flowering species were more responsive than later-flowering species, while the opposite was true at Zackenberg. Flowering shifts at Zackenberg were less variable, with advanced flowering across all 10-yr time frames. At both sites, long-term advancement seemed to be primarily driven by strong advancements in flowering in the 1990s and early 2000s.

CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of long-term trends can mask substantial variation in phenological shifts through time. This variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological shifts has implications for the evolution of flowering time and for interspecific interactions with flowering plants and can provide more detailed insights into the dynamics of phenological responses to climate change.},

abstract = {The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (Fagus sylvatica (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (Quercus petraea (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8{\%} in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after {\~{}}2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.},

abstract = {Inflammation and the resulting accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in the intrinsic and photoaging of human skin in vivo. Environmental insults such as ultraviolet (UV) rays from sun, cigarette smoke exposure and pollutants, and the natural process of aging contribute to the generation of free radicals and ROS that stimulate the inflammatory process in the skin. UV irradiation initiates and activates a complex cascade of biochemical reactions in human skin. In short, UV causes depletion of cellular antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase), initiates DNA damage leading to the formation of thymidine dimmers, activates the neuroendocrine system leading to immunosuppression and release of neuroendocrine mediators, and causes increased synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators from a variety of skin cells. The pro-inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of capillaries leading to infiltration and activation of neutrophils and other phagocytic cells into the skin. The net result of all these effects is inflammation and free radical generation (both reactive oxygen and nitrogen species). Furthermore, elastsases and other proteases (cathepsin G) released from neutrophils cause further inflammation, and activation of matrix metalloproteases. The inflammation further activates the transcription of various matrixes degrading metalloproteases, leading to abnormal matrix degradation and accumulation of non-functional matrix components. In addition, the inflammation and ROS cause oxidative damage to cellular proteins, lipids and carbohydrates, which accumulates in the dermal and epidermal compartments, contributing to the aetiology of photoaging. Strategies to prevent photodamage caused by this cascade of reactions initiated by UV include: prevention of UV penetration into skin by physical and chemical sunscreens, prevention/reduction of inflammation using anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g. cyclooxygenase inhibitors, inhibitors of cytokine generation); scavenging and quenching of ROS by antioxidants; inhibition of neutrophil elastase activity to prevent extracellular matrix damage and activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and inhibition of MMP expression (e.g. by retinoids) and activity (e.g. by natural and synthetic inhibitors).},

abstract = {The compensation heat pulse method is widely used to estimate sap flow in conducting organs of woody plants. Being an invasive technique, calibration is crucial to derive correction factors for accurately estimating the sap flow value from the measured heat pulse velocity. We compared the results of excision and perfusion calibration experiments made with mature olive (Olea europaea L. 'Manzanilla de Sevilla'), plum (Prunus domestica L. 'Songal') and orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. 'Cadenero') trees. The calibration experiments were designed according to current knowledge on the application of the technique and the analysis of measured heat pulse velocities. Data on xylem characteristics were obtained from the experimental trees and related to the results of the calibration experiments. The most accurate sap flow values were obtained by assuming a wound width of 2.0 mm for olive and 2.4 mm for plum and orange. Although the three possible methods of integrating the sap velocity profiles produced similar results for all three species, the best results were obtained by calculating sap flow as the weighted sum of the product of sap velocity and the associated sapwood area across the four sensors of the heat-pulse-velocity probes. Anatomical observations showed that the xylem of the studied species can be considered thermally homogeneous. Vessel lumen diameter in orange trees was about twice that in the olive and plum, but vessel density was less than half. Total vessel lumen area per transverse section of xylem tissue was greater in plum than in the other species. These and other anatomical and hydraulic differences may account for the different calibration results obtained for each species.},

abstract = {The release of the saltcedar beetle (Diorhabda carinulata) has resulted in the periodic defoliation of tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) along more than 1000 river km in the upper Colorado River Basin and is expected to spread along many other river reaches throughout the upper basin, and possibly into the lower Colorado River Basin. Identifying the impacts of these release programs on tamarisk water use and subsequent water cycling in arid riparian systems are largely unknown, due in part to the difficulty of measuring water fluxes in these systems. We used lab-calibrated, modified heat-dissipation sap flux sensors to monitor tamarisk water use (n=20 trees) before, during and after defoliation by the saltcedar leaf beetle during the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons (May-October) in southeastern Utah. We incorporated a simple model that related mean stem sap flux density (Js) with atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (vpd) before the onset of defoliation in 2008. The model was used to calculate differences between predicted Js and Js measured throughout the two growing seasons. Episodic defoliation resulted in a 16{\%} reduction in mean annual rates of Js in both 2008 and 2009, with decreases occurring only during the periods in which the trees were defoliated (about 6-8 weeks per growing season). In other words, rates of Js rebounded to values predicted by the model when the trees produced new leaves after defoliation. Sap flux data were scaled to stand water use by constructing a tamarisk-specific allometric equation to relate conducting sapwood area to stem diameter, and by measuring the size distribution of stems within the stand. Total water use in both years was 0.224m, representing a reduction of about 0.04myr-1. Results showed that repeated defoliation/refoliation cycles did not result in a progressive decrease in either leaf production or water use over the duration of the study. This investigation improves ground-based estimates of tamarisk water use, and will support future efforts to characterize impacts of the beetle on basin-wide hydrologic processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

As inexperienced bees are known to have strong innate colour biases we investigated whether bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies with stronger biases for the most rewarding flower colour (violet) foraged more successfully in their local flora. To test the adaptive significance of variation in innate colour bias, we compared the performance of colour-na{\"{i}}ve bees, from nine bumblebee colonies raised from local wild-caught queens, in a laboratory colour bias paradigm using violet (bee UV-blue) and blue (bee blue) artificial flowers.

In fact, the colony with the strongest bias for violet (over blue) brought in 41{\%} more nectar than the colony with the least strong bias. As violet flowers in the local area produce more nectar than blue flowers (the next most rewarding flower colour), these data are consistent with the hypothesis that local variation in flower traits could drive selection for innate colour biases.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Epilepsy is not only a neurological disorder but may also have negative psychosocial consequences on people with epilepsy (PWE) and their relatives. Epilepsy has a major impact on quality of life (QoL) in PWE and family members. However, less is known about the impact of family support and family functioning on quality of life for PWE and family members and their interaction. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate factors that influence QoL in hospitalized adult patients with epilepsy and their relatives.

METHOD: An explorative cross-sectional study has been conducted in a tertiary clinic in Switzerland. Hospitalized adult patients with epilepsy and their relatives were enrolled in the study. Subjective QoL as well as family support and family functioning were measured with patients and family members. Patients and their relatives assessed the patients' support need and their satisfaction with the care provided. In addition, patients were administered a disease-related HRQoL measure (QoLIED-36, Version 2). Backward stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis was used to explain variances in patients and relatives' subjective QoL.

RESULTS: One hundred and four dyads of patient and family member participated. Subjective QoL in patients and family members differed significantly, as did satisfaction with care delivery. In both groups family support contributed significantly to QoL. In the models 40{\%} of the variance in QoL in patients and relatives could be explained. While the quality of life of the family members was affected by the patients' knowledge about the disease and the reason for their current hospitalization, patient QoL scores had no influence on the QoL of family members. The patients' QoL, however, depended significantly on the QoL of the family members.

CONCLUSION: Interventions should address both PWE and family members and focus on the self-care improvement of PWE and the well-being and coping of family members. A patient-centred approach needs to include both the PWE and the relatives and address family support in order to alleviate stress in the patients and relatives alike.},

abstract = {Neotropical woody bamboos range from northern Mexico to southern Argentina and Chile. The most interesting aspect of bamboo biology is their flowering habit. The species that are the most intriguing are those that manifest a cyclic pattern of gregarious flowering after long vegetative periods. The flowering cycle has been described in very few species. The goal was to identify mass flowering events of woody bamboo species native to Argentina and neighboring areas, and to estimate the flowering cycle of each species. Sixteen species were surveyed: Chusquea culeou, C. deficiens, C. lorentziana, C. montana, C. quila, C. ramosissima, C. tenella, C. valdiviensis; Colanthelia rhizantha; Guadua chacoensis, G. paraguayana, G. trinii; Merostachys clausenii, M. multiramea, Rhipidocladum neumannii and R. racemiflorum. To reconstruct flowering dates, information from literature and herbarium collections was consulted and more than 990 records were gathered. Flowering cycles were estimated by recording the intervals between reported flowering events. Evidence of regular flowering cycles of ca. 30 years was found for most of the species considered. There is a remarkable concentration of flowering cycles about multiples of 15-16 years. Flowering synchrony among different species of woody bamboos was recorded for the first time in South America.},

abstract = {Flower characteristics have been traditionally considered relatively constant within species. However, there are an increasing number of examples of variation in flower characteristics. In this study, we examined the var- iation in attracting and rewarding flower characters at several ecological levels in a metapopulation of Pyrus bourgaeana in the Don? ana area (SW Spain). We answered the following questions: what are the variances of mor- phological and nectar characters of flowers? How impor- tant are intra-individual and inter-individual variance in flower characters? Are there microgeographical differences in flower characters? And if so, are they consistent between years? In 2008 and 2009, we sampled flowers of 72 trees from five localities. For six flower morphological and two nectar characteristics, we calculated coefficients of varia- tion (CV). The partitioning of total variation among- localities, among-individuals, and within-individuals was estimated. To analyze differences among localities and their consistency between years, we conducted generalized linear mixed models. The CVs of nectar characters were always higher than those of morphological characters. As expected, inter-individual variation was the main source of variation of flower morphology, but nectar characters had significant variation at both intra- and inter-individual levels. For most floral traits, there were no differences among localities. Our study documents that variation is a scale-dependent phenomenon and that it is essential to consider intra- and inter-individual variance when investi- gating the causes and consequences of variation. It also shows that single year studies of floral characters should be viewed with caution.},

@article{Vandegehuchte2012a,
abstract = {The Heat Field Deformation (HFD) method is a modern technique to assess sap flux density in trees by applying an equation which relates an empirical temperature ratio to the thermal diffusivity of the sapwood. However, this relation is based on a misinterpretation of thermal diffusivity, leading to physically incorrect units of sap flux density. Moreover, the HFD method has recently been shown to occasionally underestimate actual sap flux densities, raising the question whether species specific calibration is necessary. This paper calls attention to a correct interpretation of thermal diffusivity and investigates the correlation between sap flux density and the HFD temperature ratio based on a 3D Finite Element Model. It is shown that the original terms linking the HFD temperature ratio to sap flux density do not follow fundamental thermodynamics and, therefore, the HFD method should be considered merely empirical. Besides, the method is not only dependent on sapwood characteristics but also on sap flux density itself, necessitating a specific calibration equation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Cooley2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adaptation to different pollinators is thought to drive divergence in flower colour and morphology, and may lead to interspecific reproductive isolation. Floral diversity was tested for association with divergent pollinator preferences in a group of four closely related wildflower species: the yellow-flowered Mimulus luteus var. luteus and the red-pigmented M. l. variegatus, M. naiandinus and M. cupreus.

METHODS: Patterns of pollinator visitation were evaluated in natural plant populations in central Chile, including both single-species and mixed-species sites. Floral anthocyanin pigments were identified, and floral morphology and nectar variation were quantified in a common garden experiment using seeds collected from the study sites.

KEY RESULTS: Mimulus l. luteus, M. l. variegatus and M. naiandinus are morphologically similar and share a single generalist bumblebee pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii. Mimulus cupreus differs significantly from the first three taxa in corolla shape as well as nectar characteristics, and had far fewer pollinator visits.

CONCLUSIONS: This system shows limited potential for pollinator-mediated restriction of gene flow as a function of flower colour, and no evidence of transition to a novel pollinator. Mimulus cupreus may experience reduced interspecific gene flow due to a lack of bumblebee visitation, but not because of its red pigmentation: rare yellow morphs are equally undervisited by pollinators. Overall, the results suggest that factors other than pollinator shifts may contribute to the maintenance of floral diversity in these Chilean Mimulus species.},

abstract = {Flowering times of plants are important life-history components and it has previously been hypothesized that flowering phenologies may be currently subject to natural selection or be selectively neutral. In this study we reviewed the evidence for phenotypic selection acting on flowering phenology using ordinary and phylogenetic meta-analysis. Phenotypic selection exists when a phenotypic trait co-varies with fitness; therefore, we looked for studies reporting an association between two components of flowering phenology (flowering time or flowering synchrony) with fitness. Data sets comprising 87 and 18 plant species were then used to assess the incidence and strength of phenotypic selection on flowering time and flowering synchrony, respectively. The influence of dependence on pollinators, the duration of the reproductive event, latitude and plant longevity as moderators of selection were also explored. Our results suggest that selection favours early flowering plants, but the strength of selection is influenced by latitude, with selection being stronger in temperate environments. However, there is no consistent pattern of selection on flowering synchrony. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic selection on flowering time is consistent and relatively strong, in contrast to previous hypotheses of selective neutrality, and has implications for the evolution of temperate floras under global climate change.},

@article{Wilson2001,
abstract = {A multi-year, multi-technique study was conducted to measure evapotranspiration and its components within an uneven-aged mixed deciduous forest in the Southeastern United States. Four different measurement techniques were used, including soil water budget (1 year), sap flow (2 years), eddy covariance (5 years), and catchment water budget (31 years). Annual estimates of evapotranspiration were similar for the eddy covariance and catchment water balance techniques, averaging 571 ± 16 mm (eddy covariance) and 582 ± 28 mm (catchment water balance) per year over a 5-year period. There were qualitative similarities between sap flow and eddy covariance estimates on a daily basis, and sap flow estimates of transpiration were about 50{\%} of annual evapotranspiration estimated from eddy covariance and catchment studies. Soil evaporation was estimated using a second eddy covariance system below the canopy, and these measurements suggest that soil evaporation explains only a small portion of the difference between sap flow estimates of transpiration and eddy covariance and catchment water budget estimates of evapotranspiration. Convergence of the catchment water balance and eddy covariance methods and moderately good energy balance closure suggests that the sap flow estimates could be low, unless evaporation of canopy-intercepted water was especially large. The large species diversity and presence of ring-porous trees at our site may explain the difficulty in extrapolating sap flow measurements to the spatial scales representative of the eddy covariance and catchment water balance methods. Soil water budget estimates were positively correlated with eddy covariance and sap flow measurements, but the data were highly variable and in error under conditions of severe surface dryness and after rainfall events. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of schoolchildren with epilepsy and its determinants and the HRQoL of their parents in comparison with those of healthy children and their parents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample comprised 100 children with epilepsy (58 males), 8-16 years of age, diagnosed at least 6 months earlier. The children with epilepsy were divided into two subgroups: A, with well controlled idiopathic epilepsy, and B, with drug-resistant or symptomatic epilepsy and with concomitant neurodevelopmental problems. A control group consisted of 100 healthy age- and gender-matched children. One parent in each family completed two questionnaires standardized for use in Greece: KIDSCREEN-27 (version for parents) to assess the HRQoL of the children and SF-12 to assess the parental HRQoL. For each of the five dimensions of KIDSCREEN-27 and for the physical and mental component scales of the SF-12 tool, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was used for comparison between the various groups and subgroups. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the effect of specific illness-related factors on the five dimensions of KIDSCREEN-27 in the children with epilepsy.

RESULTS: The parent-reported scores on KIDSCREEN-27 of the children with epilepsy were worse overall than those of healthy children, but the difference reached statistical significance only for the dimensions of "physical well-being" (p = 0.001) and "school environment" (p {\textless} 0.001). The differences were greater in adolescents (age group: 13.5-16years). The worst scores were recorded in subgroup B, the children with severe epilepsy, in the dimensions "physical well-being" (p {\textless} 0.001), "school environment" (p {\textless} 0.0001), and "peers and social support" (p = 0.044). The factors found to have a significant effect on all dimensions were mental retardation, physical disability, abnormal brain imaging findings, learning problems, and, to a lesser degree, administration of a large number of antiepileptic drugs and prolonged treatment. The parents of children with resistant epilepsy and accompanying neurodevelopmental problems scored significantly worse on the SF-12 mental health scale than those of healthy children (p {\textless} 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy, particularly severe epilepsy with concomitant neurodevelopmental problems, adversely affects the HRQoL of both schoolchildren and their parents.},

abstract = {The external heat ratio method is described for measurement of low rates of sap flow in both directions through stems and other plant organs, including fruit pedicels, with diameters up to 5 mm and flows less than 2 g h−1. Calibration was empirical, with heat pulse velocity (vh) compared to gravimetric measurements of sap flow. In the four stem types tested (Actinidia sp. fruit pedicels, Schefflera arboricola petioles, Pittosporum crassifolium stems and Fagus sylvatica stems), vh was linearly correlated with sap velocity (vs) up to a vs of approximately 0.007 cm s−1, equivalent to a flow of 1.8 g h−1 through a 3-mm-diameter stem. Minimum detectable vs was approximately 0.0001 cm s−1, equivalent to 0.025 g h−1 through a 3-mm-diameter stem. Sensitivity increased with bark removal. Girdling had no effect on short-term measurements of in vivo sap flow, suggesting that phloem flows were too low to be separated from xylem flows. Fluctuating ambient temperatures increased variability in outdoor sap flow measurements. However, a consistent diurnal time-course of fruit pedicel sap flow was obtained, with flows towards 75-day-old kiwifruit lagging behind evaporative demand and peaking at 0.3 g h−1 in the late afternoon.},

abstract = {Plant compounds that are perceived by humans to have color are generally referred to as 'pigments'. Their varied structures and colors have long fascinated chemists and biologists, who have examined their chemical and physical properties, their mode of synthesis, and their physiological and ecological roles. Plant pigments also have a long history of use by humans. The major classes of plant pigments, with the exception of the chlorophylls, are reviewed here. Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids derived ultimately from phenylalanine, are water-soluble, synthesized in the cytosol, and localized in vacuoles. They provide a wide range of colors ranging from orange/red to violet/blue. In addition to various modifications to their structures, their specific color also depends on co-pigments, metal ions and pH. They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The lipid-soluble, yellow-to-red carotenoids, a subclass of terpenoids, are also distributed ubiquitously in plants. They are synthesized in chloroplasts and are essential to the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus. Betalains, also conferring yellow-to-red colors, are nitrogen-containing water-soluble compounds derived from tyrosine that are found only in a limited number of plant lineages. In contrast to anthocyanins and carotenoids, the biosynthetic pathway of betalains is only partially understood. All three classes of pigments act as visible signals to attract insects, birds and animals for pollination and seed dispersal. They also protect plants from damage caused by UV and visible light.},

abstract = {It is now widely accepted that weather conditions occurring several months prior to the onset of flowering have a major influence on various aspects of olive reproductive phenology, including flowering intensity. Given the variable characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, we analyse its influence on the registered variations in olive flowering intensity in southern Spain, and relate them to previous climatic parameters using a year-clustering approach, as a first step towards an olive flowering phenology model adapted to different year categories. Phenological data from Cordoba province (Southern Spain) for a 30-year period (1982-2011) were analysed. Meteorological and phenological data were first subjected to both hierarchical and "K-means" clustering analysis, which yielded four year-categories. For this classification purpose, three different models were tested: (1) discriminant analysis; (2) decision-tree analysis; and (3) neural network analysis. Comparison of the results showed that the neural-networks model was the most effective, classifying four different year categories with clearly distinct weather features. Flowering-intensity models were constructed for each year category using the partial least squares regression method. These category-specific models proved to be more effective than general models. They are better suited to the variability of the Mediterranean climate, due to the different response of plants to the same environmental stimuli depending on the previous weather conditions in any given year. The present detailed analysis of the influence of weather patterns of different years on olive phenology will help us to understand the short-term effects of climate change on olive crop in the Mediterranean area that is highly affected by it.},

Interventions such as educational programs and lifestyle management education to improve self-mastery and quality of life in people with epilepsy are not necessarily integrated in standard care practices.

A search of bibliographic databases was conducted, and a total of n=14 articles were included in this review. The main finding was that self-management education for adults with epilepsy shows promise to improving knowledge and self-confidence in managing one's own condition including the management of the psychosocial stressors, improvement in seizure control, and enhancement of quality of life.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Species flower production and flowering phenology vary from year to year due to extrinsic factors. Inter-annual variability in flowering patterns may have important consequences for attractiveness to pollinators, and ultimately, plant reproductive output. To understand the consequences of flowering pattern variability, a community approach is necessary because pollinator flower choice is highly dependent on flower context. Our objectives were: 1) To quantify yearly variability in flower density and phenology; 2) To evaluate whether changes in flowering patterns result in significant changes in pollen/nectar composition. We monitored weekly flowering patterns in a Mediterranean scrubland community (23 species) over 8 years. Floral resource availability was estimated based on field measures of pollen and nectar production per flower. We analysed inter-annual variation in flowering phenology (duration and date of peak bloom) and flower production, and inter-annual and monthly variability in flower, pollen and nectar species composition. We also investigated potential phylogenetic effects on inter-annual variability of flowering patterns. We found dramatic variation in yearly flower production both at the species and community levels. There was also substantial variation in flowering phenology. Importantly, yearly fluctuations were far from synchronous across species, and resulted in significant changes in floral resources availability and composition at the community level. Changes were especially pronounced late in the season, at a time when flowers are scarce and pollinator visitation rates are particularly high. We discuss the consequences of our findings for pollinator visitation and plant reproductive success in the current scenario of climate change.},

abstract = {Changes in ambient temperature affect flowering time in plants; understanding this phenomenon will be crucial for buffering agricultural systems from the effects of climate change. Here, we show that levels of FLM-$\beta$, an alternatively spliced form of the flowering repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M, increase at lower temperatures, repressing flowering. FLM-$\beta$ interacts with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP); SVP is degraded at high temperatures, reducing the abundance of the SVP-FLM-$\beta$ repressor complex and, thus, allowing the plant to flower. The svp and flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering in different temperature ranges. Control of SVP-FLM-$\beta$ repressor complex abundance via transcriptional and splicing regulation of FLM and posttranslational regulation of SVP protein stability provides an efficient, rapid mechanism for plants to respond to ambient temperature changes.},

abstract = {A new form of heat—flow analysis was developed to measure water transport in tree trunks. The application of the energy budget required the installation of heat—flow plates and thermocouples under the bark to measure the natural heat exchange between the water—conducting layer of xylem and the adjacent parts of the tree. The equipment was installed on two large branches of an ash tree and on the main trunk below. Over an extended period of time the sum of the flow through the two branches was equal to than through the main trunk, but early in the morning water loss was so high from the branch on the west side of the tree that water must have moved to it from the protected branch on the east. Immediately following sunrise, water loss from the east side was greater. During rain there was reversed transport, indicating that water was absorbed through the leaves. This method permits practically instantaneous measurement of transpiration losses from large trees with no disturbance of the environment of the crown.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to validate a novel, dual sap-flow sensor that combines two heat-pulse techniques in a single set of sensor probes to measure volumetric water use over the full range of sap flows found in grapevines. The heat ratio method (HRM), which works well at measuring low and reverse flows, was combined with the compensation heat-pulse method (CHPM) that captures moderate to high flows. Sap-flow measurements were performed on Vitis vinifera L. (cvv. Thompson seedless, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon) grapevines growing in a greenhouse and in three different vineyards, one of which contained a field weighing lysimeter. The combined heat-pulse techniques closely tracked diurnal grapevine water use determined through lysimetry in two growing seasons, and this was true even at very high flow rates ({\textgreater}6 L vine–1 h–1 for Thompson seedless vines in the weighing lysimeter). Measurements made with the HRM technique under low flow conditions were highly correlated (R2 {\~{}} 0.90) with those calculated using the compensated average gradient method that is used to resolve low flow with the CHPM method. Volumetric water use determined with the dual heat-pulse sensors was highly correlated with hourly lysimeter water use in both years (R2 = 0.92 and 0.94 in 2008 and 2009 respectively), but the nature of the relationship was inconsistent among replicate sensors. Similar results were obtained when comparing grapevine water use determined from sap-flow sensors to miniaturised weighing lysimetry of 2-year-old potted vines and to meteorological estimates for field-grown vines in two additional vineyards. The robust nature of all of the correlations demonstrates that the dual heat-pulse sensors can be used to effectively track relative changes in plant water use, but variability of flow around stems makes it difficult to accurately convert to sap-flow volumes.},

abstract = {TreeWatch.net is an initiative that has been developed to watch trees grow and function in real-time. It is a water and carbon monitoring and modeling network, in which high-quality measurements of sap flow and stem diameter variation are collected on individual trees. Automated data processing using a cloud service enables instant visualization of water movement and radial stem growth. This can be used to demonstrate the sensitivity of trees to changing weather conditions, such as drought, heat waves or heavy rain showers. But TreeWatch.net's true innovation lies in its use of these harmonized data to also parameterize process-based tree models in real-time, which makes displaying the much-needed mechanisms underlying tree responses to climate change possible. Continuous simulation of turgor to describe growth processes and long-term time series of hydraulic resistance to assess drought-vulnerability in real-time are only a few of the opportunities our approach offers. TreeWatch.net has been developed with the view to be complementary to existing forest monitoring networks and with the aim to contribute to existing dynamic global vegetation models. It provides high-quality data and real-time simulations in order to advance research on the impact of climate change on the biological response of trees and forests. Besides its application in natural forests, we also envision a broader societal application of TreeWatch.net by selecting trees in nature reserves, public areas, cities, university areas and schoolyards to teach youngsters and create public awareness on the effects of changing weather conditions on trees and forests in this era of climate change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtually all plants and animals protect themselves from the sun using vitamins C and E.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to see if a combination of topical vitamins C and E is better for UV protection to skin than an equivalent concentration of topical vitamin C or E alone.

METHODS: We developed a stable aqueous solution of 15{\%} L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and 1{\%} alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). We applied antioxidant or vehicle solutions to pig skin daily for 4 days. We irradiated (1-5x minimal erythema dose) control- and antioxidant-treated skin using a solar simulator with a 295-nm band-pass filter. On day 5, we measured antioxidant protection factor, erythema, sunburn cells, and thymine dimers.

RESULTS: The combination of 15{\%} L-ascorbic acid and 1{\%} alpha-tocopherol provided significant protection against erythema and sunburn cell formation; either L-ascorbic acid or 1{\%} alpha-tocopherol alone also was protective but the combination was superior. Application during 4 days provided progressive protection that yielded an antioxidant protection factor of 4-fold. In addition, the combination of vitamins C and E provided protection against thymine dimer formation.

CONCLUSION: Appreciable photoprotection can be obtained from the combination of topical vitamins C and E. We suggest that these natural products may protect against skin cancer and photoaging.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in ecophysiological responses to environment, such as the impact of atmospheric and soil moisture conditions on plant water regulation, limit our ability to estimate key inputs for ecosystem models. Advanced statistical frameworks provide coherent methodologies for relating observed data, such as stem sap flux density, to unobserved processes, such as canopy conductance and transpiration. To address this need, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian State-Space Canopy Conductance (StaCC) model linking canopy conductance and transpiration to tree sap flux density from a 4-year experiment in the North Carolina Piedmont, USA. Our model builds on existing ecophysiological knowledge, but explicitly incorporates uncertainty in canopy conductance, internal tree hydraulics and observation error to improve estimation of canopy conductance responses to atmospheric drought (i.e., vapor pressure deficit), soil drought (i.e., soil moisture) and above canopy light. Our statistical framework not only predicted sap flux observations well, but it also allowed us to simultaneously gap-fill missing data as we made inference on canopy processes, marking a substantial advance over traditional methods. The predicted and observed sap flux data were highly correlated (mean sensor-level Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.88). Variations in canopy conductance and transpiration associated with environmental variation across days to years were many times greater than the variation associated with model uncertainties. Because some variables, such as vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture, were correlated at the scale of days to weeks, canopy conductance responses to individual environmental variables were difficult to interpret in isolation. Still, our results highlight the importance of accounting for uncertainty in models of ecophysiological and ecosystem function where the process of interest, canopy conductance in this case, is not observed directly. The StaCC modeling framework provides a statistically coherent approach to estimating canopy conductance and transpiration and propagating estimation uncertainty into ecosystem models, paving the way for improved prediction of water and carbon uptake responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Responses of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D) generally follow an exponential decrease described equally well by several empirical functions. However, the magnitude of the decrease - the stomatal sensitivity - varies considerably both within and between species, Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of g(s) to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of g(s) at low D (less than or equal to 1 kPa), To test this relationship we used the function g(s) = g(sref) - m.InD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and g(sref) = g(s) at D = 1 kPa, Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with gs,ef (average r(2) = 0.75) with a slope of approximately 0.6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential, The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of g(s) in relation to leaf-surface D (D-s), or on sap flux-based stomatal conductance of whole trees (G(si)), or stand-level stomatal conductance (G(s)) in relation to D. Thus, individuals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential.},

The purposes of this evidence-based project were to examine the current knowledge level and disease management behaviors of patients with epilepsy in an outpatient clinic and to measure the effectiveness of implementing a self-management protocol using the Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (ESMS). Pender's health promotion model and Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory were used to guide the development and completion of this project. An evidence-based epilepsy self-management protocol was developed and implemented at an outpatient neurology clinic by an interprofessional clinic team that consisted of (a) evaluation of self-management behaviors (ESMS), (b) individual education using the ESMS and developed resources, (c) follow-up telephone call, and (d) measurement of outcomes of the self-management protocol (patient self-management [ESMS] and process). Twenty patients participated in all or portions of the protocol. Scores on the ESMS increased from preimplementation to postimplementation of the protocol (t = -2.67). Seizure management and information management were identified as the most difficult self-management areas. Recommended changes in protocol implementation include adding information about safety measures such as medical alert bracelets and driving to the educational packets. Follow-up telephone calls were discontinued because of difficulties reaching patients. The results of this study suggest that the ESMS is an acceptable tool for evaluating patients' self-management behaviors. Epilepsy self-management protocols need to include both verbal and written educational materials. Educating patients with epilepsy about positive self-management behaviors may lead to better health outcomes.},

abstract = {The temporal pattern of breeding in populations is often characterized by a pronounced temporal clustering of births, flowering or seed set. It has long been suspected that this phenomenon is not caused by climatic seasonality alone but that reproductive synchrony represents a strategy that individuals adopt to maximize reproductive success. The classical hypotheses predicting an adaptive advantage of reproductive synchrony incorporate both sociobiological and ecological explanations. However, new theoretical and empirical analyses have shown that the predicted advantage of reproductive synchrony depends on the ecological setting in which populations reproduce, and processes earlier thought to be responsible only for synchrony may under some ecological conditions lead to asynchronous reproduction being the best strategy.},

abstract = {While natural spatial temperature gradients between measurement needles have been thoroughly investigated for continuous heat-based sap flow methods, little attention has been given to how natural changes in stem temperature impact heat pulse-based methods through temporal rather than spatial effects. By modelling the theoretical equation for both an ideal instantaneous pulse and a step pulse and applying a finite element model which included actual needle dimensions and wound effects, the influence of a varying stem temperature on heat pulse-based methods was investigated. It was shown that the heat ratio (HR) method was influenced, while for the compensation heat pulse and Tmax methods changes in stem temperatures of up to 0.002 °C s(-1) did not lead to significantly different results. For the HR method, rising stem temperatures during measurements led to lower heat pulse velocity values, while decreasing stem temperatures led to both higher and lower heat pulse velocities, and to imaginary results for high flows. These errors of up to 40{\%} can easily be prevented by including a temperature correction in the data analysis procedure, calculating the slope of the natural temperature change based on the measured temperatures before application of the heat pulse. Results of a greenhouse and outdoor experiment on Pinus pinea L. show the influence of this correction on low and average sap flux densities.},

We used a modification of the heat pulse method to measure sap flow in roots of Grevillea robusta and Eucalyptus camaldulensis and demonstrated a redistribution of soil water from deeper in the profile to dry surface horizons by the root system. This phenomenon, termed hydraulic lift has been reported previously. However, we also demonstrated that after the surface soils were rewetted at the break of season, water was transported by roots from the surface to deeper soil horizons – the reverse of the hydraulic lift behaviour described for other woody species. We suggest that hydraulic redistribution of water in tree roots is significant in maintaining root viability, facilitating root growth in dry soils and modifying resource availability.},

abstract = {Inferring whole-tree sap flow rates (Q) with thermometric sap flow sensors requires specification of physiological and structural attributes of trees. Using sap temperature measurements to estimate Q with the heat-ratio method (HRM) requires quantification of the water content (mc), basic density ($\rho$b), and depth (Rs) of sapwood. Values of mc and $\rho$b serve to estimate sapwood thermal diffusivity (k), a necessary variable in the calculation of heat-pulse velocity (Vh) that is often set to a nominal value (k{\_}nom); mc and $\rho$b are also used to convert Vh to sap velocity (Vs). The sapwood area across which Vs is integrated is often estimated on the basis of Rs. Because mc and $\rho$b are correlated and influence Q through estimation of k and the conversion of Vh to Vs, we sought to quantify the potential error introduced when Q is calculated with k{\_}nom rather than with k as estimated from measurements of mc and $\rho$b in five coniferous species. We also examined how variation in mc, $\rho$b, and Rs across sampling scales may contribute to uncertainty in estimated Q. Across the observed range of mc and $\rho$b, the two traits contributed to a net decline in the process of estimating Vs from Vh (with k{\_}nom). This suggests that the use of k{\_}nom rather than a calculated k may result in overestimation of Q when mc and $\rho$b co-vary as they did in our study. Variability in mc and $\rho$b across sampling scales could induce errors greater than 10{\%} in Vs (and hence Q), while within- and among-tree variability in Rs could impart even greater errors (up to 130{\%}). We propose that this uncertainty be represented in the expression of error in whole-tree sap flow estimates and in statistical analyses involving those estimates.},

abstract = {Flowering times are well-documented indicators of the ecological effects of climate change and are linked to numerous ecosystem processes and trophic interactions. Dozens of studies have shown that flowering times for many spring-flowering plants have become earlier as a result of recent climate change, but it is uncertain if flowering times will continue to advance as temperatures rise. Here, we used long-term flowering records initiated by Henry David Thoreau in 1852 and Aldo Leopold in 1935 to investigate this question. Our analyses demonstrate that record-breaking spring temperatures in 2010 and 2012 in Massachusetts, USA, and 2012 in Wisconsin, USA, resulted in the earliest flowering times in recorded history for dozens of spring-flowering plants of the eastern United States. These dramatic advances in spring flowering were successfully predicted by historical relationships between flowering and spring temperature spanning up to 161 years of ecological change. These results demonstrate that numerous temperate plant species have yet to show obvious signs of physiological constraints on phenological advancement in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {The compensation heat-pulse method (CHPM) for measuring sap velocity in tree stems shows a poor performance for low velocities. Here we present a new procedure, that extends the validity of the technique down to zero and even for small negative values of the corrected heat-pulse velocity vc. A simulation model of heat transport for the sensor inserted in the tree showed that vcis linearly related to the average temperature difference ($\Delta$Ta) between the 2 needles from negative vcup to 30 cm h-1. The relation was confirmed for olives and pistachio trees in the field with no apparent variation for very long periods (months). The procedure, named "calibrated average gradient" (CAG), consists in averaging the $\Delta$Tameasurements after the pulse, then obtaining empirically the function vc= f ($\Delta$ Ta) in its linear domain, when vcis still measurable with the traditional CHPM. The calibrated function can then be used to calculate vcbelow the minimum velocity measurable by the CHPM as determined by the measuring system resolution. The vc= f ($\Delta$ Ta) function is sensor-specific and depends only on sensor characteristics and thermal properties; its empirical fit allows not only estimating vcfor low transpiration conditions, but may also serve to check possible variations in sensor performance or changes in thermal properties of xylem tissue caused by wounding, advocating the need to re-install sensors in a new position. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations occupy almost 20 million ha worldwide and exceed 3.7 million ha in Brazil alone. Improved genetics and silviculture have led to as much as a three-fold increase in productivity in Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil and the large land area occupied by these highly productive ecosystems raises concern over their effect on local water supplies. As part of the Brazil Potential Productivity Project, we measured water use of Eucalyptus grandis × urophylla clones in rainfed and irrigated stands in two plantations differing in productivity. The Aracruz (lower productivity) site is located in the state of Espirito Santo and the Veracel (higher productivity) site in Bahia state. At each plantation, we measured stand water use using homemade sap flow sensors and a calibration curve using the clones and probes we utilized in the study. We also quantified changes in growth, leaf area and water use efficiency (the amount of wood produced per unit of water transpired). Measurements were conducted for 1 year during 2005 at Aracruz and from August through December 2005 at Veracel. Transpiration at both sites was high compared to other studies but annual estimates at Aracruz for the rainfed treatment compared well with a process model calibrated for the Aracruz site (within 10{\%}). Annual water use at Aracruz was 1394 mm in rainfed treatments versus 1779 mm in irrigated treatments and accounted for approximately 67{\%} and 58{\%} of annual precipitation and irrigation inputs respectively. Increased water use in the irrigated stands at Aracruz was associated with higher sapwood area, leaf area index and transpiration per unit leaf area but there was no difference in the response of canopy conductance with air saturation deficit between treatments. Water use efficiency at the Aracruz site was also not influenced by irrigation and was similar to the rainfed treatment. During the period of overlapping measurements, the response to irrigation treatments at the more productive Veracel site was similar to Aracruz. Stand water use at the Veracel site totaled 975 mm and 1102 mm in rainfed and irrigated treatments during the 5-month measurement period respectively. Irrigated stands at Veracel also had higher leaf area with no difference in the response of canopy conductance with air saturation deficit between treatments. Water use efficiency was also unaffected by irrigation at Veracel. Results from this and other studies suggest that improved resource availability does not negatively impact water use efficiency but increased productivity of these plantations is associated with higher water use and should be given consideration during plantation management decision making processes aimed at increasing productivity.},

abstract = {Sap flow measurements have become integral in many physiological and ecological investigations. A number of methods are used to estimate sap flow rates in trees, but probably the most popular is the thermal dissipation (TD) method because of its affordability, relatively low power consumption, and ease of use. However, there have been questions about the use of this method in ring-porous species and whether individual species and site calibrations are needed. We made concurrent measurements of sap flow rates using TD sensors and the tissue heat balance (THB) method in two oak species (Quercus prinus Willd. and Quercus velutina Lam.) and one pine (Pinus echinata Mill.). We also made concurrent measurements of sap flow rates using both 1 and 2-cm long TD sensors in both oak species. We found that both the TD and THB systems tended to match well in the pine individual, but sap flow rates were underestimated by 2-cm long TD sensors in five individuals of the two ring-porous oak species. Underestimations of 20-35{\%} occurred in Q. prinus even when a "Clearwater" correction was applied to account for the shallowness of the sapwood depth relative to the sensor length and flow rates were underestimated by up to 50{\%} in Q. velutina. Two centimeter long TD sensors also underestimated flow rates compared with 1-cm long sensors in Q. prinus, but only at large flow rates. When 2-cm long sensor data in Q. prinus were scaled using the regression with 1-cm long data, daily flow rates matched well with the rates measured by the THB system. Daily plot level transpiration estimated using TD sap flow rates and scaled 1 cm sensor data averaged about 15{\%} lower than those estimated by the THB method. Therefore, these results suggest that 1-cm long sensors are appropriate in species with shallow sapwood, however more corrections may be necessary in ring-porous species.},

Answering this question requires us to understand how pollinators analyze these signals with their visual and olfactory sense organs, and how the sensory systems work together with post-receptor neural wiring to produce a coherent percept of the world around them. Recent research on the dynamics with which bees store, manage and retrieve memories all have fundamental implications for how pollinators choose between flowers, and in turn for floral evolution. New findings regarding how attention, peak-shift phenomena, and speed-accuracy tradeoffs affect pollinator choice between flower species show that analyzing the evolutionary ecology of signal-receiver relationships can substantially benefit from knowledge about the neural mechanisms of visual and olfactory information processing.},

abstract = {[1] The role of evapotranspiration (ET) in the global, conti- nental, regional, and local water cycles is reviewed. Elevated atmospheric CO2, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (D), turbulent transport, radiative transfer, and reduced soil moisture all impact biotic and abiotic processes controlling ET that must be extrapolated to large scales. Suggesting a blueprint to achieve this link is the main compass of this review. Leaf-scale transpiration ( fe) as governed by the plant biochemical demand for CO2 is first considered. When this biochemical demand is combined with mass transfer formu- lations, the problem remains mathematically intractable, requiring additional assumptions. A mathematical “closure” that assumes stomatal aperture is autonomously regulated so as to maximize the leaf carbon gain while minimizing water loss is proposed, which leads to analytical expressions for leaf-scale transpiration. This formulation predicts well the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and increases in D on fe. The case of soil moisture stress is then considered using extensive gas exchange measurements collected in drought studies. Upscaling the fe to the canopy is then discussed at multiple time scales. The impact of limited soil water avail- ability within the rooting zone on the upscaled ET as well as some plant strategies to cope with prolonged soil moisture stress are briefly presented. Moving further up in direction and scale, the soil-plant system is then embedded within the atmospheric boundary layer, where the influence of soil moisture on rainfall is outlined. The review concludes by discussing outstanding challenges and how to tackle them by means of novel theoretical, numerical, and experimental approaches.},

Here, we analyse floral colour using reflectance spectra that include near-UV and examined the phylogenetic signal of floral colour. We found that coflowering species within communities tended to be more divergent in floral colour than expected by chance. However, coflowering species were not phylogenetically dispersed, in part due to our finding that floral colour is a labile trait with a weak phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, while we found that locally rare and common species exhibited equivalent floral colour distances from their coflowering neighbours, frequent species (those found in more communities) exhibited higher colour distances from their coflowering neighbours. Our findings support recent studies, which have found that (i) plant lineages exhibit frequent floral colour transitions; and (ii) traits that influence local population dynamics contribute to community structure.},

abstract = {Functional convergence in water use of trees across species from diverse geographic locations was examined using data on tree water use parameters, with the intention of gaining an understanding on the capacity for water transport for trees with varying structural and functional traits. Wood density ($\rho$w), which is reported to have a negative exponential relation with sap flow density (SFD), showed a bell-shaped curve when the daily SFD data from 101 tree species belonging to 35 angiosperm and gymnosperm families were plotted. The species came from 23 different geographical locations representing all continents. Trees were most efficient in water transport when the $\rho$w was between 0.51 and 0.65 g cm−3. When the $\rho$w increased or decreased from this range, there was a gradual fall in their water transport rate as indicated by lower daily SFD. The unexpected reduction in SFD with decreasing $\rho$w is explained in terms of reduced conductance in the transport pathway, which is a precaution taken by the tree for avoiding cavitation or implosion in larger conducting tubes, which is characteristic of low density wood. The development of severe leaf water potential variations, which is frequently reported in such trees, supports this notion. The SFD versus $\rho$w relation has a potentially wide applicability in predicting water use by forest stands with varying $\rho$w. In addition, the occurrence of a high number of tree species with $\rho$w values in the range of 0.51–0.65 g cm−3 across all continents examined points towards the importance of $\rho$w in the evolutionary process as related to efficient functioning of the water transport mechanism.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY. The fitness of plants depends on their immediate biotic and abiotic environmental surroundings. The floral neighborhood of individual plants is part of this immediate environment and affects the frequency and behavior of their pollinators. However, the interactions among plants for pollination might differ among populations because populations differ in floral densities and pollinator assemblages. Despite that, manipulative experiments of the floral neighborhood in different populations with a specific focus on pollinator behavior are still rare. METHODS. We introduced mixtures of two species (Salvia farinacae and Tagetes bonanza) in two populations of Taraxacum officinale and examined their effect on pollinators' foraging behavior on Taraxacum. KEY RESULTS. The effects of the heterospecific neighborhood differed among pollinator groups and between the two populations. Only honeybees consistently preferred both the most diverse (containing three species) and completely pure patches of Taraxacum in both populations. We found a strong and positive effect of patch diversity on visitation to Taraxacum in one population, whereas in the other population either no effect or a negative effect of plant diversity occurred, which we attribute to differences between populations in the ratio of pollinators to inflorescences. Pollinator visitation consistently increased with local Taraxacum density in both populations. CONCLUSIONS. Our study shows that a similar local neighborhood can differentially affect the frequency and foraging behavior of pollinators, even in closely situated populations. Experimental studies conducted in several populations would contribute to determine which factors drive the variation in pollination interactions among populations.},

abstract = {Early season transpiration of 5-year-old Pyrus serotina trees receiving different amounts of irrigation was measured using lysimetry and the compensation heat-pulse technique. Withholding water resulted in a rapid decline in soil-water content within the lysimeters, and caused a 50{\%} decrease in stomatal conductance and a 25-35{\%} reduction in tree water use. Weekly transpiration rates, as determined by integrated heat-pulse measurements, were comparable with measurements by lysimetry for a well-watered tree, but overestimated water use by a water-stressed tree by 22{\%}. The reason for this discrepancy was thought to be diurnal changes in sapwood water content, leading to an overestimation by the heat-pulse technique. Stomatal conductance and meteorological data obtained over 2 days were used to parameterize a Penman-Monteith model to estimate tree transpiration. On a daily basis, these estimates were within 8{\%} of the sap flow determined by the heat-pulse technique. Substantial sap flow occurred in the stressed tree at night even when the stomata were closed. Obviously, this night-time sap flow could not be predicted by the Penman-Monteith model. Instead, it appeared to be a capacitance effect owing to the nocturnal refilling of the tree's internal store of water. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {mThe use of stem sap flow data to estimate diurnal whole-tree transpiration and canopy stomatal conductance depends critically upon knowledge of the time lag between transpiration and water flux through the stem. In this study, the time constant for water movement in stems of 12-year- old Pinus taeda L. individuals was estimated from analysis of time series data of stem water flux and canopy transpira- tion computed from mean daytime canopy conductance, and diurnal vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation measurements. Water uptake through stems was measured using a constant-heat sapflow probe. Canopy transpiration was correlated to stem uptake using a resistance-capaci- tance equation that incorporates a time constant parameter. A least-squares auto-regression determined the parameters of the resistance-capacitance equation. The time constants for ten loblolly pine trees averaged 48.0 (SE = 2.0) min and the time lag for the diurnal frequency averaged 47.0 (SE = 2.0) min. A direct-cross correlation analysis between canopy transpiration and sap flow time series showed maximum correlation at an approximately 30 min lag. Residuals (model-predicted minus actual stem flow data) increased with increasing soil moisture depletion. While the time constants did not vary significantly within the range of tree sizes studied, hydraulic resistance and capacitance terms were individually dependent on stem cross-sectional area: capacitance increased and resistance decreased with stem volume. This result may indicate an inverse adjust- ment of resistance and capacitance to maintain a similar time constant over the range of tree sizes studied.},

abstract = {We compared half-hourly transpiration data of a single adult almond tree given by a weighing lysimeter (Ely) to that supplied by compensation heat pulse (CHP) sap flow probes (trunk, Ft, and branches, F bi, sap flow). The lysimeter was covered with a plastic film to minimize soil evaporation. The tree was subjected to alternate periods of full irrigation and shortage of water imposed during a period of high climatic demand (June-August, Cartagena, Southern-Spain). Ft was measured on the north and south sides of the trunk (Fts and Ftn, respectively) and Fbi was determined on the three main branches. It was observed that the position of sap flow probes influenced the values of Ft, with higher rates (∼ 35{\%}) occurring at the south location. Using a wounding width of 3.4 mm, a good agreement was obtained at a daily scale between Ely and the mean value of trunk sap flow, Ftm = (Fts + Ftn)/2. Total branch sap flow overestimated E ly by approximately 40{\%}, suggesting that the wounding width to be used for branches would be somewhat lower than that of the trunk. It was concluded that, once calibrated, the CHP technique is able to supply accurate and detailed information for the study of the short-term dynamics of almond tree water status and its response to abiotic stresses.},

An increase in the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, and hence a shift from pristine nitrogen limitation to human-induced phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth, seems to have been driven by deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. These findings challenge the classical paradigm of lake phytoplankton productivity being naturally limited by phosphorus availability. However, atmospheric phosphorus deposition may also be highly relevant. Here we show how dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration has decreased in the Pyrenean lake district over recent decades, despite there being an increase in deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. This is related to an increased atmospheric phosphorus load in the lake water, as a result of higher atmospheric inputs. These changes are causing phytoplankton to revert from being phosphorus-limited to being nitrogen-limited.},

abstract = {Phenology—the timing of biological events—is highly sensitive to climate change. However, our general understanding of how phenology responds to climate change is based almost solely on incomplete assessments of phenology (such as first date of flowering) rather than on entire phenological distributions. Using a uniquely comprehensive 39-y flowering phenology dataset from the Colorado Rocky Mountains that contains more than 2 million flower counts, we reveal a diversity of species-level phenological shifts that bring into question the accuracy of previous estimates of long-term phenological change. For 60 species, we show that first, peak, and last flowering rarely shift uniformly and instead usually shift independently of one another, resulting in a diversity of phenological changes through time. Shifts in the timing of first flowering on average overestimate the magnitude of shifts in the timing of peak flowering, fail to predict shifts in the timing of last flowering, and underrepresent the number of species changing phenology in this plant community. Ultimately, this diversity of species-level phenological shifts contributes to altered coflowering patterns within the community, a redistribution of floral abundance across the season, and an expansion of the flowering season by more than I mo during the course of our study period. These results demonstrate the substantial reshaping of ecological communities that can be attributed to shifts in phenology. },

abstract = {Natural temperature gradients in stems of trees growing in open stands give rise to errors when measuring sap flow by the continuous thermal dissipation method. Previously, we obtained evidence from field measurements that a noncontinuous thermal dissipation system can prevent these errors (Do and Rocheteau 2002). Cyclic heating (i.e., 45 minutes on and 15 minutes off; 45/15) allowed the derivation of an alternate signal, defined as the difference between the temperature signal at the end of the heating period and the temperature signal at the end of the cooling period. By analogy with the continuous system, we calculated an alternate flow index. Analysis in an artificial flow system confirmed that external temperature gradients have an additive effect on the continuous signal, whereas the alternate signal is unaffected by such gradients. The response of the alternate flow index to flow densities was similar for five combinations of heating and cooling times (45/15, 40/20, 30/30, 15/15 and 10/10 min). The relationship was markedly different from Granier's (1985) calibration because measurements in cyclic systems are made under non-steady-state temperature conditions. We recommend the 15/15 min cycle, which allows two sap flow measurements per hour. We compared flow density estimates obtained from field measurements with the continuous and cyclic systems over 192 days with 1-day lags between systems. Comparisons based on daily maximum values (between 0.5 and 2.5 l dm(-2) h(-1) for the cyclic system) confirmed that differences between the continuous and cyclic systems, which could be greater than 100{\%}, were linked to the effect of temperature gradients on the continuous system. The results demonstrate that, in situations where significant natural temperature gradients (i.e., {\textgreater} 0.2 degrees C) are likely, the cyclic system improves the accuracy of sap flow measurements made with thermal dissipation probes.},

abstract = {Aim Characterizing the variation of functional traits in nature is a first step towards linking environmental changes to changes in ecosystem function. Here we aim to characterize the spatial variability of major plant functional traits along wide environmental gradients in Mediterranean and temperate forests, and assess to what extent this variability differs between two dominant families in Northern Hemisphere forests: Fagaceae and Pinaceae. Location Catalonia (north-east Iberian Peninsula). Methods Four functional traits were selected to incorporate information on both the leaf and the wood economic spectra: maximum tree height (Hmax), wood density (WD), leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content of leaves (Nmass). We quantified the variance distribution of each functional trait across three nested ecological scales: population, species and family. Through such scales, we explored the spatial variation of functional traits through climatic and biotic gradients, as well as the covariation among traits. Results Functional trait variability was distributed across all the ecological scales considered, but mostly at the family level, with functional traits differing markedly between Fagaceae and Pinaceae. Within families, variation in functional traits was similar or higher within species than between species. The spatial variability in functional traits was related to biotic and abiotic gradients, although this effect was quantitatively small compared with differences between families. Covariation among functional traits was not necessarily conserved across ecological scales. Trait covariation across all species was structured along the Hmax−WD and LMA−Nmass axes, but this structure was partially lost within families, where variation was mostly structured along the Hmax−LMA and WD−Nmass axes. Main conclusions Intraspecific variation emerges as a fundamental component of functional trait structure along wide environmental gradients. Understanding the sources of intraspecific variation, as well as how it contributes to community assembly and ecosystem functioning, thus becomes a primary research question.},

abstract = {Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area (Ā) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = ĀN) and size to number ratio (S = Ā/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (K(S)) and wood density (D; dry mass/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in K(S) was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (D(N)) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster K(S) but incur greater freeze-thaw embolism risk. F should also affect K(S), and both F and D(N) should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.},

abstract = {Available sap flow methods are still far from being simple, cheap and reliable enough to be used beyond very specific research purposes. This study presents and tests a new single-probe heat pulse (SPHP) method for monitoring sap velocity in trees using a single-probe sensor, rather than the multi-probe arrangements used up to now. ? Based on the fundamental conduction?convection principles of heat transport in sapwood, convective velocity (Vh) is estimated from the temperature increase in the heater after the application of a heat pulse (DT). The method was validated against measurements performed with the compensation heat pulse (CHP) technique in field trees of six different species. To do so, a dedicated three-probe sensor capable of simultaneously applying both methods was pro- duced and used. ? Experimental measurements in the six species showed an excellent agreement between SPHP and CHP outputs for moderate to high flow rates, confirming the applicability of themethod. ? In relation to other sap flow methods, SPHP presents several significant advantages: it requires low power inputs, it uses technically simpler and potentially cheaper instrumentation, the physical damage to the tree is minimal and artefacts caused by incorrect probe spacing and alignment are removed.},

abstract = {The use of dietary botanicals is receiving considerable interest in the protection of skin from the adverse biological effects of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Dietary feeding of proanthocyanidins extracted from grape seeds (GSP) (0.2 and 0.5{\%}, w/w) in AIN76 control diet to SKH-1 hairless mice resulted in prevention of photocarcinogenesis in terms of tumor incidence (20-95{\%}), tumor multiplicity (46-95{\%}) and tumor size (29-94{\%}) against UVB-induced complete (both initiation + promotion), initiation and promotion stages of photocarcinogenesis. Feeding of GSP (0.5{\%}, w/w) also resulted in prevention of malignant transformation of UVB-induced papillomas to carcinomas in terms of carcinoma incidence (45{\%}), carcinoma multiplicity (61{\%}) and carcinoma size (75{\%}) compared with non-GSP treated mice following UVB-induced complete carcinogenesis protocol at the end of 30 weeks. Biochemical analysis revealed that treatment of GSP in vivo and in vitro systems significantly inhibited UVB- or Fe3+-induced lipid peroxidation by 57-66{\%} (P{\textless}0.01) and 41-77{\%} (P{\textless} 0.05-0.001), respectively, thus suggesting the antioxidant mechanism of photoprotection by GSP. Long-term feeding of GSP did not show apparent signs of toxicity in mice when determined in terms of body weight, diet consumption and physical characteristics of internal body organs like spleen, liver and kidney. Feeding of GSP also did not show apparent signs of toxicity when determined in terms of total body mass (mass of lean + fat), total bone mineral density and total bone mineral content by employing dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA analysis also revealed that feeding of GSP significantly decreased tissue fat level (24-27{\%}, P{\textless}0.05) without changing the total body mass of the animals compared with non-GSP-fed animals. This can be attributed to increased lipolysis or decreased synthesis of fat due to administration of GSP. Together, it can be suggested that inhibition of photocarcinogenesis by GSP treatment may be associated with the reduction in UVB-induced oxidative damage and tissue fat content.},

Additionally, the composition of phenolic compounds and carotenoids in both extracts was determined by LC-MS/MS. The major phenolic compounds identified and quantified (dry matter) in the skin and pulp extracts of P. cattleianum were ellagic acid (2213-3818 $\mu$g/g extracts), ellagic acid deoxyhexoside (1475-2,070 $\mu$g/g extracts) and epicatechin gallate (885-1,603 $\mu$g/g extracts); while all-trans-lutein (2-10 $\mu$g/g extracts), all-trans-antheraxanthin (1.6-9 $\mu$g/g extracts) and all-trans-$\beta$-carotene (4-6 $\mu$g/g extracts) were the major carotenoids identified in both extracts. P. cattleianum pulp extract showed higher scavenging capacity than skin extract for all tested ROS and RNS. Considering the potential beneficial effects to human health, P. cattleianum may be considered as a good source of natural antioxidants and may be useful for the food and phytopharmaceutical industry.},

abstract = {Human use of land has transformed ecosystem pattern and process across most of the terrestrial biosphere, a global change often described as historically recent and potentially catastrophic for both humanity and the biosphere. Interdisciplinary paleoecological, archaeological, and historical studies challenge this view, indicating that land use has been extensive and sustained for millennia in some regions and that recent trends may represent as much a recovery as an acceleration. Here we synthesize recent scientific evidence and theory on the emergence, history, and future of land use as a process transforming the Earth System and use this to explain why relatively small human populations likely caused widespread and profound ecological changes more than 3,000 y ago, whereas the largest and wealthiest human populations in history are using less arable land per person every decade. Contrasting two spatially explicit global reconstructions of land-use history shows that reconstructions incorporating adaptive changes in land-use systems over time, including land-use intensification, offer a more spatially detailed and plausible assessment of our planet's history, with a biosphere and perhaps even climate long ago affected by humans. Although land-use processes are now shifting rapidly from historical patterns in both type and scale, integrative global land-use models that incorporate dynamic adaptations in human-environment relationships help to advance our understanding of both past and future land-use changes, including their sustainability and potential global effects.},

abstract = {Variation in flowering plant density can have conflicting effects on pollination and seed production. Dense flower patches may attract more pollinators, but flowers in those patches may also compete for pollinator visits and abiotic resources. We examined how natural and experimental conspecific flowering plant density affected pollen receipt and seed production in a protandrous, bumble bee-pollinated wildflower, Delphinium barbeyi (Ranunculaceae). We also compared floral sex ratios, pollinator visitation rates, and pollen limitation of seed set from early to late in the season to determine whether these factors mirrored seasonal changes in pollen receipt and seed production. Pollen receipt increased with natural flowering plant density, while seed production increased across lower densities and decreased across higher flower densities. Experimental manipulation of flowering plant density did not affect pollinator visitation rate, pollen receipt, or seed production. Although pollinator visitation rate increased 10-fold from early to late in the season, pollen receipt and seed set decreased over the season. Seed set was never pollen-limited. Thus, despite widespread effects of flowering plant density on plant reproduction in other species, the effects of conspecific flowering plant density on D. barbeyi pollination and seed production are minor.},

The objective was to study the relationship between water flow through the trunk and temperature measurements determined by probes inserted in the papaya plant stem in laboratory. In addition, was possible to study the relationship between sap flow and instantaneous gas exchange in field conditions. We constructed an instrument that maintained a stable water flux through a 0.30 m stem section with a constant pressure, simulating the xylem sap flow through the stem. Water flux was adjusted by varying pressure of water in the stem section. The mathematical model used to fit the relation between K (Granier heat coefficient) values and sap flow density was the exponential model: u = 0.5511 × K1.9104. Field studies was conducted in a commercial orchard located in North of the State of Rio de Janeiro, with 12 plants in October 2002, and eight plants in January 2003. We verified that instantaneous transpiration, measured by a portable system of gas exchange (porometry), presented a good (R2 = 0.75) positive relationship with xylem sap flow. Estimates of papaya sap flow can be obtained by scaling portable photosynthesis system measurements with exposed leaves, however the relationship is non-linear in higher instantaneous transpiration rates. The causes of the non-linear relationship in higher transpiration are discussed. In addition, was possible to obtain a good (R2 = 0.76) relationship between net photosynthesis rate and xylem sap flow in papaya field-grown. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Epilepsy self-management is the total sum of steps that people perform to maximize seizure control, to minimize the impact of having a seizure disorder, and to maximize quality of life. As part of a phased approach to instrument development, we conducted descriptive analyses of data from epilepsy self-management items covering 10 domains of self-management gathered from 422 adults with epilepsy from multiple study sites. Participants most frequently reported performing sets of behaviors related to managing treatment and stigma, information seeking, managing symptoms, and communicating with providers. Behaviors reported with lower frequency were related to seeking social support and engaging in wellness behaviors. Significant differences for the domains were found for income, gender, and education levels but not for other different demographic variables. A subsequent analytic phase, reported in a companion article, will use factor analysis to identify and validate the subscale structure of the domains.},

This method was used to measure rates of sap movement in stem sections of Actinidia chinensis 'Hort16A' vines. Water passing through these sections was collected and compared with the estimates obtained from the 'Tmax' method. Sap flows were also measured, in a whole kiwifruit vine, using the 'Tmax' technique and were in good agreement with calculated transpiration rates. Transpiration rates reached a maximum of about 60 L d-1 for kiwifruit vines in mid summer. },

@article{Rezzani2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sun exposure is responsible for long-term clinical skin changes such as photoageing, photodamage and photocancers. Ultraviolet (UV)A wavelengths stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may contribute to photoageing. To protect against oxidative stress, skin cells have developed several defence systems, including ROS and metal ion scavengers and a battery of detoxifying, haem-degrading and repair enzymes. Melatonin's antioxidant activity is the result of three different but complementary actions: (i) a direct action due to its ability to act as a free radical scavenger; (ii) an indirect action that is a consequence of melatonin's ability to reduce free radical generation (radical avoidance); and (iii) its ability to upregulate antioxidant enzymes.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we focused our attention on the prevention of photodamage, choosing melatonin as an antioxidant agent.

METHODS: In the present study we analysed the effects of pretreatment of murine fibroblasts cells (NIH3T3) with melatonin (1 mmol L(-1) ) followed by UVA irradiation (15 J cm(-2) ). Thereafter, changes in components of the extracellular matrix and in some antioxidant enzymes (inducible and constitutive haem oxygenase) were evaluated.

RESULTS: We observed that UVA radiation caused altered expression of extracellular matrix proteins and induced the expression of inducible haem oxygenase. This increase was not sufficient to protect the cells from damage. Instead, melatonin pretreatment led to increased expression of haem-degrading enzymes and suppression of UVA-induced photodamage.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that melatonin, as a modifier of the dermatoendocrine system, may have utility in reducing the effects of skin ageing.},

abstract = {Renewable fresh water over continents has input from precipitation and losses to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Global-scale estimates of transpiration from climate models are poorly constrained owing to large uncertainties in stomatal conductance and the lack of catchment-scale measurements required for model calibration, resulting in a range of predictions spanning 20 to 65 per cent of total terrestrial evapotranspiration (14,000 to 41,000 km(3) per year) (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Here we use the distinct isotope effects of transpiration and evaporation to show that transpiration is by far the largest water flux from Earth's continents, representing 80 to 90 per cent of terrestrial evapotranspiration. On the basis of our analysis of a global data set of large lakes and rivers, we conclude that transpiration recycles 62,000 ± 8,000 km(3) of water per year to the atmosphere, using half of all solar energy absorbed by land surfaces in the process. We also calculate CO2 uptake by terrestrial vegetation by connecting transpiration losses to carbon assimilation using water-use efficiency ratios of plants, and show the global gross primary productivity to be 129 ± 32 gigatonnes of carbon per year, which agrees, within the uncertainty, with previous estimates. The dominance of transpiration water fluxes in continental evapotranspiration suggests that, from the point of view of water resource forecasting, climate model development should prioritize improvements in simulations of biological fluxes rather than physical (evaporation) fluxes.},

abstract = {Most flower visitors innately prefer a particular color and scent, and use them as cues for flower recognition and selection. However, in most cases, since color and scent serve as a combined signal, not only does the preference for an individual cue, but also the preference hierarchy among different cues, influence their flower visitation. In the present study, we attempted to reveal (1) the chromatic and (2) the olfactory cues that stimulate flower visiting, and (3) the preference hierarchy between these cues, using the naive adult butterfly Vanessa indica. When we offered 12 different-colored (six chromatic and six achromatic) paper flower models, V. indica showed a color preference for yellow and blue. When we examined the proboscis extension reflex (PER) of V. indica towards 16 individual compounds identified in the floral scents from two nectar plants belonging to the family Compositae, Taraxacum officinale and Cirsium japonicum, six compounds were found to have relatively high PER-eliciting activities, including benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and (E+Z)-nerolidol. When we combined color and scent cues in two-choice bioassays, where butterflies were offered flower models that were purple (a relatively unattractive color), the models scented with these active compounds were significantly more attractive than the odorless controls. In addition, synthetic blends mimicking the floral scents of T. officinale and C. japonicum (at doses equivalent to that of ten flowers) enhanced the number of visits to the scented models. However, the effect of odorizing was not conspicuous in parallel bioassays when yellow flower models were used, and the butterflies also significantly preferred odorless yellow models to scented purple models. These results demonstrate that V. indica depends primarily on color and secondarily on scent during flower visitation.},

abstract = {Although thermal diffusivity is a crucial parameter for sap flow calculations in both the heat field deformation and the heat ratio method, it is seldom measured on a routine basis. This paper presents a theory based on thermodynamic principles to determine both axial and tangential diffusivity in sapwood. By measuring the temperature response after application of a heat pulse at a short axial and tangential distance from a line heater, axial and tangential thermal conductivity as well as volumetric heat capacity of the sapwood can be derived from a theoretical model. From these parameters, axial and tangential diffusivity can easily be determined. Sensitivity analysis and results of an experiment on European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) confirm the applicability of the method. The obtained thermal diffusivities ranged from 2.7×10-7m2s-1 to 2.2×10-7m2s-1 for a relative water content (moisture per dry weight) ranging from 0.47 to 0.90, respectively. This was on average 22{\%} lower than when applying the common methodology based on wood core sampling. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25{\%} of the total trait variation within communities and 32{\%} of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {Use of Granier-style heat dissipation sensors to measure sap flow is common in plant physiology, ecology and hydrology. There has been concern that any change to the original Granier design invalidates the empirical relationship between sap flux density and the temperature difference between the probes. Here, we compared daily water use estimates from gravimetric measurements with values from variable length heat dissipation sensors, which are a relatively new design. Values recorded during a one-week period were compared for three large pot-grown saplings of each of the tropical trees Pseudobombax septenatum (Jacq.) Dugand and Calophyllum longifolium Willd. For five of the six individuals, P values from paired t-tests comparing the two methods ranged from 0.12 to 0.43 and differences in estimates of total daily water use over the week of the experiment averaged {\textless} 3{\%}. In one P. septenatum sapling, the sap flow sensors underestimated water use relative to the gravimetric measurements. This discrepancy could have been associated with naturally occurring gradients in temperature that reduced the difference in temperature between the probes, which would have caused the sensor method to underestimate water use. Our results indicate that substitution of variable length heat dissipation probes for probes of the original Granier design did not invalidate the empirical relationship determined by Granier between sap flux density and the temperature difference between probes.},

abstract = {Granier's technique of measuring sap flux density using a continuous heating system was tested on young mango trees. On containerized trees, sap flow underestimated transpiration measured gravimetrically by less than 10 {\%}. In a 4-year-old field-grown tree, there was only a 5 {\%} difference between cumulative summed sap flow in the branches and sap flow in the trunk over a 24-h period. Positioning of the sap flux sensor on the trunk was found to be non-critical for sap flow measurement in trees of diameter of less than 10 cm. Granier's sap flux sensor was sensitive to both slow and abrupt changes in canopy transpiration induced by successive branch girdling, defoliation and excision. A comparison of sap flow in the branches and water uptake by the tree measured using the 'cut-tree method' showed that sap flow method underestimated the actual water uptake by less than 6 {\%}. The results of this study indicate that Granier's sap flux sensor is suitable for measuring whole-tree transpiration in young mango trees.},

abstract = {Vegetation and the water cycles are inherently coupled across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Water availability interacts with plant ecophysiology and controls vegetation functioning. Concurrently, vegetation has direct and indirect effects on energy, water, carbon, and nutrient cycles. To better understand and model plant–water interactions, highly interdisciplinary approaches are required. We present an overview of the main processes and relevant interactions between water and plants across a range of spatial scales, from the cell level of leaves, where stomatal controls occur, to drought stress at the level of a single tree, to the integrating scales of a watershed, region, and the globe. A review of process representations in models at different scales is presented. More specifically, three main model families are identified: (1) models of plant hydraulics that mechanistically simulate stomatal controls and/or water transport at the tree level; (2) ecohydrological models that simulate plot- to catchment-scale water, energy, and carbon fluxes; and (3) terrestrial biosphere models that simulate carbon, water, and nutrient dynamics at the regional and global scales and address feedback between Earth's vegetation and the climate system. We identify special features and similarities across the model families. Examples of where plant–water interactions are especially important and have led to key scientific findings are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the various data sources that are currently available to force and validate existing models, and we present perspectives on the evolution of the field.},

abstract = {Recent work has suggested that the large earlywood vessels of ring-porous trees can be extraordinarily vulnerable to cavitation making it necessary that these trees maintain a consistent and favorable water status. We compared cavitation resistance, vessel refilling, transport capacity and water status in a study of ring-porous Quercus gambelii Nutt. (oak) and diffuse-porous Acer grandidentatum Nutt. (maple). These species co-dominate summer-dry foothills in the western Rocky Mountains of the USA. Native embolism measurements, dye perfusions and balance pressure exudation patterns indicated that the large earlywood vessels of 2-3-year-old oak stems cavitated extensively on a daily basis as predicted from laboratory vulnerability curves, resulting in a more than 80{\%} reduction in hydraulic conductivity. Maple branches showed virtually no cavitation. Oak vessels refilled on a daily basis, despite negative xylem pressure in the transpiration stream, indicating active pressurization of embolized vessels. Conductivity and whole-tree water use in oak were between about one-half and two-thirds that in maple on a stem-area basis; but were similar or greater on a leaf-area basis. Oak maintained steady and modest negative xylem pressure potentials during the growing season despite little rainfall, indicating isohydric water status and reliance on deep soil water. Maple was markedly anisohydric and developed more negative pressure potentials during drought, suggesting use of shallower soil water. Although ring porosity may have evolved as a mechanism for coping with winter freezing, this study suggests that it also has major consequences for xylem function during the growing season.},

Chronic UV radiation exposure-induced skin diseases or skin disorders are caused by the excessive induction of inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage, etc. The use of chemopreventive agents, such as plant polyphenols, to inhibit these events in UV-exposed skin is gaining attention. Chemoprevention refers to the use of agents that can inhibit, reverse or retard the process of these harmful events in the UV-exposed skin. A wide variety of polyphenols or phytochemicals, most of which are dietary supplements, have been reported to possess substantial skin photoprotective effects. This review article summarizes the photoprotective effects of some selected polyphenols, such as green tea polyphenols, grape seed proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, silymarin and genistein, on UV-induced skin inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage, etc., with a focus on mechanisms underlying the photoprotective effects of these polyphenols. The laboratory studies conducted in animal models suggest that these polyphenols have the ability to protect the skin from the adverse effects of UV radiation, including the risk of skin cancers. It is suggested that polyphenols may favorably supplement sunscreens protection, and may be useful for skin diseases associated with solar UV radiation-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and DNA damage.},

abstract = {The impact of climate change on the advancement of plant phenological events has been heavily studied in the last decade. Although the majority of spring plant phenological events have been trending earlier, this is not universally true. Recent work has suggested that species that are not advancing in their spring phenological behavior are responding more to lack of winter chill than increased spring heat. One way to test this hypothesis is by evaluating the behavior of a species known to have a moderate to high chilling requirement and examining how it is responding to increased warming. This study used a 60-year data set for timing of leaf-out and male flowering of walnut (Juglans regia) cultivar 'Payne' to examine this issue. The spring phenological behavior of 'Payne' walnut differed depending on bud type. The vegetative buds, which have a higher chilling requirement, trended toward earlier leaf-out until about 1994, when they shifted to later leaf-out. The date of male bud pollen shedding advanced over the course of the whole record. Our findings suggest that many species which have exhibited earlier bud break are responding to warmer spring temperatures, but may shift into responding more to winter temperatures (lack of adequate chilling) as warming continues.},

abstract = {Key message: A high spatial resolution dataset of sap flux density in subtropical conifers is used to assess the minimum number and location of sap flow sensors required to monitor tree transpiration accurately. Abstract: Tree transpiration is commonly estimated by methods based on in situ sap flux density (SFD) measurements, where the upscaling of SFD from point measurements to the individual tree has been identified as the main source of error. The literature indicates that the variation in SFD with radial position across a tree stem section can exhibit a wide range of patterns. Adequate capture of the SFD profile may require a large number of point measurements, which is likely to be prohibited. Thus, it is of value to develop protocols, which rationalize the number of point measurements, while retaining a satisfactory precision in the tree SFD estimates. This study investigates cross-sectional SFD variability within a tree and successively for six individual trees within a stand of Pinus elliottii var. elliottii × caribaea var. hondurensis (PEE × PCH). The stand is part of a plantation in subtropical coastal Australia. SFD is estimated using the Heat Field Deformation method simultaneously for four cardinal directions with measurements at six depths from the cambium. This yields a reference value of single tree SFD based on the twenty-four point measurements. Large variability of SFD is observed with measurement depth, cardinal direction and selected tree. We suggest that this is linked to the occurrence of successive narrow early and latewood rings with contrasting-specific hydraulic conductivities and wood water contents. Thus, an accurate placement of sensors within each ring is difficult to achieve in the field with the sensor footprint covering several rings of both early and latewood. Based on the reference dataset, we identified both an “ideal” setup and an “optimal” setup in terms of cost effectiveness and accuracy. Our study shows the need of using a systematic protocol to optimize the number of sensors to be used as a trade-off between precision and cost. It includes a preliminary assessment of the SFD variability at a high spatial resolution, and only then based on this, an appropriate placement of sensors for the long-term monitoring.},

abstract = {Concern regarding the biological effects of climate change has led to a recent surge in research to understand the consequences of phenological change for species interactions. This rapidly expanding research program is centered on three lines of inquiry: (1) how the phenological overlap of interacting species is changing, (2) why the phenological overlap of interacting species is changing, and (3) how the phenological overlap of interacting species will change under future climate scenarios. We synthesize the widely disparate approaches currently being used to investigate these questions: (1) interpretation of long-term phenological data, (2) field observations, (3) experimental manipulations, (4) simulations and nonmechanistic models, and (5) mechanistic models. We present a conceptual framework for selecting approaches that are best matched to the question of interest. We weigh the merits and limitations of each approach, survey the recent literature from diverse systems to quantify their use, and characterize the types of interactions being studied by each of them. We highlight the value of combining approaches and the importance of long-term data for establishing a baseline of phenological synchrony. Future work that scales up from pairwise species interactions to communities and ecosystems, emphasizing the use of predictive approaches, will be particularly valuable for reaching a broader understanding of the complex effects of climate change on the phenological overlap of interacting species. It will also be important to study a broader range of interactions: to date, most of the research on climate-induced phenological shifts has focused on terrestrial pairwise resource-consumer interactions, especially those between plants and insects.},

abstract = {The transient thermal dissipation (TTD) method developed by Do and Rocheteau (2002b) is a close evolution of the original constant thermal dissipation (CTD) method of Granier (1985). The TTD method has the advantage of limiting the influence of passive natural temperature gradients and of yielding more stable zero-flux references at night. By analogy with the CTD method, the transient method was first calibrated on synthetic porous material (sawdust) on the assumption that the relationship was independent of the woody species. Here, our concern was to test the latter hypothesis with a 10-min heating time in three tropical species: Hevea brasiliensis M{\"{u}}ll. Arg., Mangifera indica L. and Citrus maxima Merr. A complementary objective was to compare the field estimates of daily transpiration for mature rubber trees with estimates based on a simplified soil water balance in the dry season. The calibration experiments were carried out in the laboratory on cut stems using an HPFM device and gravimetric control of water flow up to 5 L dm(-2) h(-1). Nineteen response curves were assessed on fully conductive xylem, combining 11 cut stems and two probes. The field evaluation comprised five periods from November 2007 to February 2008. Estimates of daily transpiration from the measurement of sap flow were based on the 41 sensors set up on 11 trees. Soil water depletion was monitored by neutron probe and 12 access tubes to a depth of 1.8 m. The calibrations confirmed that the response of the transient thermal index to flow density was independent of the woody species that were tested. The best fit was a simple linear response (R(2) = 0.88, n = 276 and P {\textless} 0.0001). The previous calibration performed by Do and Rocheteau (2002b) on sawdust fell within the variability of the multi-species calibration; however, there were substantial differences with the average curve at extreme flow rates. Field comparison with soil water depletion in the dry season validated to a reasonable extent the absolute estimates of transpiration acquired with the 10-min TTD method. In conclusion, evidence for the independence of calibration from woody species and the simple linear response of the thermal index strengthen the interest of the TTD method with 10-min heating.},

The hydrophilic/lipophilic character of these compounds was evaluated, and their antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH method. The percutaneous absorption of these polyphenols was obtained by an in vitro methodology using porcine skin biopsies. This methodology involves the quantification of the antioxidants present in each specific skin layer to evaluate antioxidant effectiveness. The antioxidant activity in each skin layer was also determined by the DPPH method. The results indicated that lipophilic antioxidants (epicatechin, resveratrol, quercetin, and trolox) penetrated deeper into the skin layers, whereas a more hydrophilic compound, rutin, remained on the skin surface. The antioxidant evaluation of each skin compartment suggested that resveratrol and rutin were the most effective topically applied compounds in view of their antioxidant activity and their skin penetration profile.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic skin exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stimulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through c-Jun and c-Fos activation. These signaling cascades induce the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, resulting in photoaging.

METHODS: This study evaluated the preventive effect of the ethanol extract of Kaempferia parviflora Wall. ex. Baker (black ginger) on UVB-induced photoaging in vivo. To investigate the antiphotoaging effect of K. parviflora extract (KPE), UVB-irradiated hairless mice administered oral doses of KPE (100 or 200 mg/kg/day) for 13 weeks.

RESULTS: In comparison to the UVB control group, KPE significantly prevented wrinkle formation and the loss of collagen fibers with increased type I, III, and VII collagen genes (COL1A1, COL3A1, and COL7A1). The decrease in wrinkle formation was associated with a significant reduction in the UVB-induced expression of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 via the suppression of c-Jun and c-Fos activity. KPE also increased the expression of catalase, which acts as an antioxidant enzyme in skin. In addition, expression of inflammatory mediators, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B), interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), was significantly reduced by KPE treatment.

CONCLUSION: The results show that oral administration of KPE significantly prevents UVB-induced photoaging in hairless mice, suggesting its potential as a natural antiphotoaging material.},
