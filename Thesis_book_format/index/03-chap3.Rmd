\section*{Abstract}
Niche-based species distribution modelling (SDM) has become one of the most pervasive tools in ecology and biogeography. SDM relate species occurrences with the environmental conditions found at these sites. Climatic variables are usually included in SDMs as averages of a reference period (30-50 years). To date, the impact of not including climatic variability when estimating species niche and predicting species distributions has been scarcely considered. Here we first develop a method to include inter-annual climatic variability in niche characterization. We then compare climatic suitability obtained from averaged-based and from inter-annual variability-based niches by analyzing their respective capacities to explain demographic responses to extreme climatic events. Furthermore, we assessed the relative differences in niche space when including climatic variability in species with different distribution ranges. We found that climatic suitability obtained from both niches quantifications significantly explained species demographic responses. However, climatic suitability from inter-annual variability-based niches showed higher explanatory capacity, especially for populations located in the non-overlapping area between the two types of niches that tend to be geographically marginal populations. In addition, species with restricted distribution ranges increased relatively more their niche space, when considering climatic variability, probably because in widely distributed species, spatial variability compensates for temporal variability. According to our results, the common use of climatic averages when characterizing species niches could lead to overestimations of species extinction risk, underestimations of species distribution areas and risk of species invasions, or errors in conservation plans derived from SDM. From our study, we highlight that including climatic variability in SDM is particularly important when dealing with species with restricted distribution and populations at the margin of their niche.\par

##Introduction 
In recent years Species Distribution Modelling has become a very active field in biogeography, ecology and conservation sciences  (Guisan et al. 2013, Araújo et al. 2019). This technique has been widely used for many purposes, such as niche quantification (Austin et al. 1990, Breiner et al. 2017),  test of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses (Leathwick 1998, Anderson et al. 2002, Graham et al. 2004, Mellert et al. 2011), prediction of the effects of global change on biodiversity (Thomas et al. 2004, Thuiller et al. 2005b), support of conservation plans (Hannah et al. 2007, Tulloch et al. 2016), or estimation of invasive species risk (Peterson and Vieglais 2001, Petitpierre et al. 2012).\par

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are generally correlative models that statistically relate species’ presences with the environmental conditions of sites where species occur (Franklin 2010, Peterson 2011, Guisan et al. 2017). These models are deeply founded on the Hutchinson's ecological niche concept (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000), what implies that species’ observed ranges are the geographical translation of species’ environmental requirements in the n-dimensional space - defined by these requirements-, discarding the areas where competitors impede the species presence (Soberón and Nakamura 2009). Several limitations of this method have been recognized, linked to both the underpinning theory and the commonly used methodologies. Some of the most criticized  limitations include: the equilibrium assumption (Guisan and Thuiller 2005), which neglect any lag between climate changes and species distributions (Svenning and Skov 2004, Blonder et al. 2015); the lack of inclusion of biotic interactions or migration rates (Guisan and Thuiller 2005, Barve et al. 2011) due to the difficulty to report this information in a broad geographic scale; the niche conservatism assumption (Pearman et al. 2008), since these models implicitly consider that the niche remains constant over time when projected in time and space (Guisan et al. 2017); or the frequent use of exclusively climatic predictors (Franklin 2010, Thuiller 2013), partly encouraged by their widespread availability in contrast to the lack of fine grain resolution of other important environmental variables (e.g., soils in plant distributions). Furthermore, climatic variables are usually included as monthly or annual average of reference periods of 30 to 50 years  (Hijmans et al. 2005, Karger et al. 2017, Fick and Hijmans 2017), in most cases, irrespective of whether modeled species’ lifespan is significantly longer or shorter than these periods.\par

From a theoretical view, characterizing the environmental requirements which constitute the Hutchinsonian niche (Soberón 2007), using exclusively historical averages could be constraining to a greater or lesser extent the real volume of species’ niche in the n-dimensional space. By not accounting for climate variability, it is assumed that, for example, two species living under the same mean average temperature for a given period have the same thermal niche, even if one of them live under a yearly constant climate while the other suffer wide fluctuations in temperatures between years. Accordingly, it could be expected that the impact of including inter-annual variability in niche modelling could not be very important for species inhabiting areas with little temporal climatic variability. However, differences between the niche characterized with climatic averages and the niche characterized with inter-annual variability is likely substantial for those species living in habitats submitted to wide inter-annual climatic variability. In a similar way, it could be expected that species with small distribution ranges will have greater increases in the estimation of their niche size when we include inter-annual variability in relation to those species with larger geographic distribution areas, where spatial variability could compensate for temporal variability.\par

The potential distortion in niche size caused by the non-inclusion of the inter-annual climate variability would have implications on different facets of ecology and biogeography. For example, we could have been underestimating the present and future potential species distribution areas. Furthermore, if niche suitability and population dynamics are theoretically related (Pulliam 2000), niche breadth underestimation could contribute, among other ecological implications, to decouple macroclimatic suitability and demographic processes (Thuiller et al. 2014, Csergő et al. 2017). For instance, niche suitability estimated from average climate could predict population absence or decline in some environmental areas where the population intrinsic growth rate is still positive. Particularly, considering climatic variability could be especially relevant when predicting biodiversity changes under current climate change scenario in which both recurrence of climatic extremes and temperature climate means are increasing (Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012, IPCC Working Group 1 2014). Depending on the magnitude of extreme climatic events, these could promote populations changes in their position in the environmental space, that may even push them outside of the species niche, a situation that would correspond to reduced populations capacity to survive if these conditions persists. But if niches are wider than traditionally considered, for a given change in climatic conditions the probability of populations to be pushed out of the niche size would be reduced. Accordingly, neglecting temporal climatic variability in SDMs could have led to the overestimation of population and species extinction risk under climate change.\par

Despite these substantial implications, inter-annual variability has been scarcely considered in SDMs (Zimmermann et al. 2009). Studies that have accounted for it, have included the inter-year variability as a new dimension of the environmental hyperspace (Zimmermann et al. 2009) or have considered the standard deviation of the climatic suitability over different years when explaining demographic responses (Lloret and Kitzberger 2018). However, in any case there is a clear assessment of the direct impact of including inter-annual climatic variability on niche breadth.\par

Here, we (1) developed a procedure to include yearly climatic resolution in species niche characterization, and (2) assessed whether this inclusion of inter-annual variability improves the expected correspondence between niche suitability and population-level processes, which in our case correspond to populations responses to an extreme climatic event. Particularly, we used decay data across more than 4,000 $km^2$ of *Pinus halepensis* L. forests affected by an extreme drought year in the Spanish southeast (Esteve-Selma et al. 2015). In addition, (3) we quantified the relative change in niche size when considering inter-annual climatic variability respect to only considering average climate, for species with different extent of their distribution areas across the Mediterranean basin, which corresponds to contrasting climatic ranges.\par

##Material and methods
Here we infer species niches by projecting geographic occurrences into two-dimensions environmental space and then estimating kernel densities (Broennimann et al. 2012, Blonder et al. 2014). Considering all the yearly climatic records of every species’ occurrences for a given period, we obtain the “inter-annual variability-based” niche while by considering only the average climate of every species’ occurrences we obtain the species "average-based" niche.\par

####Niche suitability and demographic responses in *Pinus halepenis*
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
*Demographic response data*\par

The study was carried out across forests of *Pinus halepensis* in the Region of Murcia (Spanish southeast) (Figure 3.1), an area which represents the arid limit of the species distribution. The average climate of this region is characterized by annual mean temperature of 18° C, and annual rainfall ranging from 240 to 400 mm (Worldclim v 2.0, Fick and Hijmans 2017). During the hydrological year 2013-2014 the Iberian southeast suffered the most intense drought on records, recording on average less than 50 % of the average precipitation for the period 1970-2000 (AEMET 2014)(Appendix B Figure B.1) and causing an extensive die-off and plant mortality in forest and woodlands ecosystems (Esteve-Selma et al. 2015).\par
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}

*Pinus halepensis* decay data were collected for the whole Region of Murcia after the extreme drought episode by the Health Forest Unit of the Agriculture and Water Council of Murcia. Data were recorded and translated to raster format of 1 $km^2$  considering two categories:  highly affected forests and unaffected forests, covering a total of 4378 $km^2$. Around 20% of the forest surface of the region was highly affected. In addition, from this total surface, 264 plots were selected to measure the percentage of affectation from satellite imagery in order to have also a continuous data set which offer more information than the binary one. These decay percentage values were then contrasted in the field for 14 plots, obtaining a correlation of 0.79. Therefore, we used two databases, one with binary data and other with continuous values in order to better contrast our hypotheses (Figure 3.1).\par

*Species niche characterization based on climate average vs inter-annual variability*\par

*Pinus halepensis* occurrences dataset used to characterize species niche were collected from the third Spanish National Forest Inventory (IFN3 2007). Summarizing a total of 9959 occurrences along the whole country after removing *Pinus* plantations. This occurrence dataset already covers most of the *Pinus halepensis* climatic range (Mauri et al. 2016).\par
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}
As climatic dataset we used 12 bioclimatic variables for every year of the period 1979-2007 (Chelsa database, Karger et al 2017): bio 1 (annual mean temperature), bio 4 (temperature seasonality), bio 5 (maximum temperature of warmest month), bio 6 (minimum temperature of coldest month), bio 10 (mean temperature of warmest quarter), bio 11 (mean temperature of coldest quarter), bio 12 (annual precipitation), bio 13 (precipitation of wettest month), bio 14 (precipitation of driest month), bio 15 (precipitation seasonality -coefficient of variation), bio 16 (precipitation of wettest quarter) and bio 17 (precipitation of driest quarter); all of them with 1 $km^2$ resolution. The period of time was selected in order to use the most accurate climatic layers, i.e. after 1979 (Karger et al. 2017), and to be in concordance with the occurrence database, i.e. until 2007, when IFN3 was carried on.\par

From these 12 bioclimatic variables, we obtained an inter-annual climatic dataset by extracting the climatic values of *Pinus* occurrences locations for every year of the period 1979-2007 (that is, 9959 occurrences x 28 years) and an average climatic dataset by estimating the mean climate of the 28-year period for every occurrence location. From the inter-annual climatic dataset we built the environmental space by using a PCA to reduce the climatic space of the 12 variables into a two dimensional space (Broennimann et al. 2012).\par

This two-dimension environmental space was used to represent both the *Pinus* averaged-based niche and the *Pinus* inter-annual variability-based niche by translating the climatic values of *Pinus* occurrences into this environmental space. We then used kernel density function to determine the *Pinus* density for each cell of the two-dimensional environmental space, by applying Gaussian kernel, selecting optimal bandwidth by cross-validation (Duong and Hazelton 2005) and removing values under the 0.05 percentile. Finally, niche suitability was estimated by dividing each niche density value by the maximum density value of the niche, obtaining values ranging between 0 and 1.\par

We then obtained the climatic suitability of *Pinus* populations affected by drought, after translating the climatic conditions of each population during the extreme year into the two-dimensional environmental space. Climatic conditions of the extreme year 2013–2014 were obtained from monthly precipitation and maximum, minimum, and mean temperature records from between 68 and 114 weather stations of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). This climatic dataset was translated into 1 $km^2$ resolution-maps following Ninyerola et al. (2000) with latitude, longitude and elevation as explanatory variables for climate. Then we applied the ‘‘biovars’’ function (dismo package; Hijmans et al. 2016) to convert them into the final bioclimatic variables format. Finally, we selected the same 12 bioclimatic variables as used for niche characterization.\par
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
*Suitability-decay analyses*\par 
We applied GLM models with populations decay (binary or continuous) as response variable, and populations niche suitability during the extreme year (estimated from inter-annual variability or average based niches) as explanatory variable. We produced four alternative GLM models: binary decay vs. niche suitability from averaged based-model, binary decay vs. niche suitability from inter-annual variability-based model, continuous decay vs. niche suitability from averaged-based model, continuous decay vs. niche suitability from inter-annual variability-based model. Every model used binomial error distribution. These models allow us to compare the accuracy of the relationship between populations decay and niche suitability depending on niche characterization approach (inter-annual or average based).\par
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}
In order to know whether this possible difference in accuracy varied in relation to populations location within the species niche size, we simulated 30,000 decay datasets by sub setting the continuous dataset. Particularly, niche suitability differences are expected to be maximum in the not shared space by both niches, based respectively on average and inter-annual variability (Appendix B Figure B.3), since average-based niche predict 0 suitability while inter-annual variability-based niche predict positive suitability values. So, we randomly simulated different percentages of populations located in the non-shared space ranging from 0% to 100% with a population size ranging from 118 to 263 in order to maximize the total number of populations in each case. Then we compared the explained $R^2$ and p-value obtained from GLM models with population continuous decay as response variable and average or inter-annual niche-based suitability as response variable (see above explanation) and population size for each population simulated dataset (in order to correct the possible low performance of dataset with les number of populations).\par

####Change in niche size and species climatic range
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
*Species niche characterization based on climate average vs inter-annual variability*\par

We characterized the niche of 42 Mediterranean species with distribution areas ranging from the whole Mediterranean basin to endemic species (i.e. mediterranean, occidental mediterrean, iberoafrican and Iberian Peninsula SE endemic species, Appendix B Table B.1) using the average and the inter-annual variability-based approaches. Species occurrence data were collected from (GBIF 2019, http://www.gbif.org) and herbarium of Jardí Botànic de Barcelona. Then, species’ occurrence records were filtered to remove taxonomic inconsistencies as well as to reduce possible sampling bias by reducing observed occurrences to 1 per 1 $km^2$ grid cell. Final datasets ranged from 200 to 10,000 observations per species.\par
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}
Average and inter-annual climatic datasets were obtained from CHELSA database  (Karger et al. 2017) for the period 1979-2013. We selected the same 12 bioclimatic variables as selected above for *P. halepensis*. We obtained the environmental space by using a PCA built using inter-annual climatic data from all the occurrences of all 42 analyzed species (Broennimann et al. 2012) (Appendix B Table B.1). We estimated averaged and inter-annual variability-based niches by translating each species occurrences into the environmental space and using kernel density functions as described above.\par
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
*Change in niche area –climatic range analyses*\par

From these niches, we calculated the ratio between the niche size (area) determined with the inter-annual-based approach and the average-based approach. Finally, we used linear models (lm) with niches’ ratio as response variable and average-based niche size logarithmically transformed and species distribution range as response variables.\par
\setlength{\parindent}{30pt}

##Results

####Niche suitability and demographic responses

The two first PCA axes explained 60% of the variability of the 12 climatic variables (Appendix B Figure B.2). The niche of *P. halepensis* characterized with inter-annual variability (inter-annual variability-based niche) was 42% larger than the niche estimated with the average dataset (average-based niche). These differences implied that during the extreme climatic year, 93.3% of unaffected forests and 63.3% of highly affected forests were inside the *P. halepensis* niche estimated with inter-annual variability. These values diminished to 52.8% for unaffected forests and 21.2% for highly affected ones when niche was calculated with average climate (Figure 3.2).\par

```

Models which relate species decay with species niche suitability during the extreme year obtained with both average-based and inter-annual variability-based niches, show that populations suitability significantly explained species decay irrespective of the decay dataset (binary or continuous) (Figure 3.3, Appendix B Table B.1). However, models with inter-annual variability-based niche suitability had a better fit explaining decay records and had considerably lower AIC (particularly for continuous dataset, see Figure 3.3).\par

The explanatory capacity of models that include suitability from inter-annual variability-based niche was always higher than that of models including average-based niche suitability, independently of the proportion of populations located in the non-shared area by both niches. Difference between the two models predictive capacity increased as the percentage of populations located in the non-shared area increased (Appendix B Figure B.4 and Table B.2).\par

####Change in niche size and species climatic range
The two first PCA axes explained 60.8% of the variability of the 12 climatic variables (Appendix B Figure B.5). Lm models across species with different distribution ranges showed that species with smaller average-based niche area, which correspond to species with more restricted distribution range, increased more their niche area when considering inter-annual climatic suitability than species with larger average-based niche area and wider distribution ranges (Figure 3.4 and Appendix B Table B.3). In addition, there were no differences between distribution range groups in the relationship of niche area ratio with area of average-based species’ niche (Appendix B Table B.3).\par

##Discussion
####Including inter-annual variability in niche characterization
This study brings out some limitations of the prevalent niche characterization based on average climate. Accounting for the temporal climatic variability in the locations where species occur increases the range and resolution of species climatic requirements constituting the climatic niche, leading to an increase of niche size respect to the typical use of climate averages. Differently from other studies which include climatic extremes or standard deviation of inter-year climate as a new dimension of the environmental hyperspace (Zimmermann et al. 2009) in addition to climatic means, we included the whole distribution of climatic data across time for all occurrence sites, not adding new dimensions. This procedure allowed effectively quantify differences in niche size. Among all the time that a population has remained at a given site, climate likely have exceeded the species tolerance limits in some years. But these macroclimatic extreme conditions do not necessarily result in population extinction, due to more favorable conditions in microsites, species local adaptation or facilitation species interactions (Benito Garzón et al. 2011, De Frenne et al. 2013, Svenning and Sandel 2013), particularly for long-lived species. Including macroclimatic conditions that overpass the species tolerance limits could lead to overestimate species climatic niche size. This problem can be dealt by removing certain percentile of niche density (in our case, the 5% percentile) when delimiting niche size. In spite of this consideration, our approach presumably distorts niche size less than accounting only for average climate. Inter-annual variability could be also incorporated in different SDMs algorithms allowing for a hierarchical data structure (Wang and Maintainer 2016, Kuznetsova et al. 2017). Finally, including climatic variability when building SDMs is particularly promising under the current climate scenario since it supposes a more conservative approach to determine future species distribution in changing climates.\par



####Climatic variability improves the relationship between macroclimatic suitability and demography
Our results emphasize the relevance of accounting climatic variability to explain the relationship between demographic processes and macroclimatic suitability, specifically under extreme climatic events. We found that *P. halepensis* climatic suitability estimated from niches characterized by inter-annual climatic variability better predicted species decay in comparison to climatic suitability estimated from niches that only considered climatic average (Figure 3.3) under extreme events. It is theoretically assumed that if species niche is properly represented, there should be a correspondence between population demographic processes (such as growth or mortality rates) and niche parameters (Pulliam 2000, Thuiller et al. 2014, Csergő et al. 2017). Multiple studies have tried to assess this relationship (Thuiller et al. 2014, Csergő et al. 2017), particularly under extreme events (Lloret and Kitzberger, 2018, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018, Sapes et al. 2017), however this correspondence does not always emerge (Thuiller et al. 2014, van der Maaten et al. 2017). Very often these niche-demography relationships, particularly in case of parameters related to growth, are affected by many local aspects that impede identifying a clear relationship between niche and population performance (Csergő et al. 2017). Nevertheless, the presence of decoupling factors does not override the potential impact of climatic variability when estimating population dynamics from species niche. Actually, neglecting temporal variability in this kind of studies could introduce a substantial error when predicting population performance in fluctuating environments (Niehaus et al. 2012). Although suitability derived from average-based niche may be robust enough to explain dramatic demographic responses under extreme climatic episodes, as  showed in our results (see also Lloret and Kitzberger 2018, Pérez Navarro et al. 2018, Sapes et al. 2017), the better the characterization of the niche, the better the species fitness’ predictions.\par

In addition, the inclusion of inter-annual variability when predicting species responses is especially relevant for populations located in the non-overlapping space between the two niche margins (i.e. corona, between inter-annual and average-based niches) (Appendix B Figure B.4). This area of the species niche (when considering a two-dimensions of the space niche) corresponds to unsuitable climatic conditions according to average-based niche but suitable climatic conditions when including climatic variability in niche characterization. Therefore, average-based niche in this non-shared area does not have predictive capacity for demographic responses. Thus, if the locations' sample was composed only by populations from this area, the only model using climatic suitability that would predict populations response correctly and significantly would be the inter-annual-based one (Appendix B Figure B.5). This mismatch would also imply that populations located in this area, which in many cases correspond to populations sited at the geographic range margin, would be wrongfully located out of the niche size when using average-based species niche.\par

####Change in niche size across species with different climatic and distribution ranges 
These abovementioned implications of including inter-year variability could be even more important for species with narrow distribution ranges, which implies smaller average-based niche, comparing with those with broader distribution. Our results showed that, in the Mediterranean basin, species with smaller average-based niche areas increased relatively more their niche area when considering inter-annual climatic variability (Figure 3.4), probably because in species with narrow distribution ranges, spatial climatic variability do not compensate for temporal variability. Therefore, endemic and rare species probably would increase more their niche size, particularly when inhabiting highly fluctuating climates.\par

####Other implications of inter-annual variability vs average-based climatic models 
This study highlights some limitations that have been barely considered to date of using climatic averaged datasets of 30-50 years’ periods (Hijmans et al. 2005, Karger et al. 2017, Fick and Hijmans 2017) when modelling species niche (Zimmermann et al. 2009). Not accounting for the whole temporal climatic resolution of species occurrences when modelling climatic niche could result in errors affecting from the characterization of species geographical distribution to extinction risk estimates. Underestimations in niche size could lead to understate species geographically suitable areas and such errors could be then also propagated into management plans derived (i.e. selection of favorable areas for protecting species or assisted migrations). Most importantly, these possible niche underestimations could vary depending on species distribution ranges. In addition to the error derived from the non-inclusion of climatic variability, using systematically 30-years averaged climatic periods could be specially pernicious when characterizing the climatic niche of short-lived species, as in plagues (Jaime et al. 2019) since they emerge explosively as a consequence of specific climatic conditions that appear in particular years of the period.\par

Estimates of invasion risk or extinction rate could be also affected by niche characterization errors. In this case, niche size underestimation could lead to understate invasion risk or to overestimate extinction debt as populations and species could be able to survive under changing climates or extreme events more than expected with average-based niches. In addition to temporal climatic variability there are others sources of climatic variability not included in the prevalent climatic datasets (Worldclim, CHELSA), such as the climatic heterogeneity held within geographic units due to a coarse spatial resolution (Geiger et al. 1995, Lenoir et al. 2013, De Frenne et al. 2013, Lembrechts et al. 2019a). This lack of resolution, which could be particularly important for plants living in particularly favorable microhabitats, and for small-stature plants which actually experience temperatures at ground-surface level (Lembrechts et al. 2019a), may hinder to accurately portray species requirements (Guisan et al. 2019) and can neglect the important buffer capacity of microclimates on the ecosystem response to climate change (Ackerly et al. 2010). Nevertheless, high resolution climatic datasets - even at daily resolution - are increasingly becoming available (Wan 2008, Bramer et al. 2018) and they suppose a promising option to deal with these spatial and temporal limitations.\par
