Despite the fact that forest transpiration is the main terrestrial evaporative flux and a key component of the global hydrological cycle and Earth System functioning, its quantification is still replete with uncertainty [@Schlesinger2014]. Our knowledge of how trees control transpiration in response to hydrometeorological conditions worldwide remains incomplete. Transpiration regulation and water use strategy under drought conditions determine individual survival [@choat_triggers_2018], which extends to forest function and dynamics across the globe, impacting the provision of forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, hydroclimatic regulation and biodiversity conservation [@trumbore_forest_2015]. Thus, a better understanding of transpiration and its spatiotemporal variability will improve assessments of vegetation dynamics and climate feedbacks at regional to global scales, especially in the face of global change [@choat_triggers_2018], which is increasing drought episodes and their severity in several regions [@Dai2013]. Along this thesis I have tried to give a global perspective on the ecohydrological variables driving the regulation of transpiration using sap flow data at the whole-tree level. Due to the lack of a global and harmonized database of sap flow measurements in the past, this sort of synthesis had not been attempted before. However, the launch of the SAPFLUXNET database, to which I have contributed, has made this possible. Because a global, harmonized sap flow database requires comparability across methods, the second chapter of this thesis deals with calibration uncertainty of different sap flow techniques. \par

##Improving sap flow techniques to obtain reliable estimates of tree level transpiration

To reduce the uncertainty in our knowledge of plant water transport processes, it is essential to first reduce the uncertainty in the measurements of plant water flow. All sap flow methods have specific limitations [@Vandegehuchte2013; @Smith1996] and can yield biased estimates, which implies that this bias needs to be taken into account when sap flow data are used in quantitative analyses (Chapter 2). In particular, I show that heat dissipation techniques, which are by far the most widely used method, consistently underestimate sap flow by 40% on average (if used with its original calibration coefficients; Chapter 2). At the same time, all methods provide high average correlations between sap flow measurements and actual values, suggesting that they are suitable for studies based on qualitative or relative values, including research on the relative importance of the hydrometeorological drivers explaining canopy conductance (Chapter 4), or on the sensitivity of transpiration to hydrometeorological drivers (Chapter 5). \par

To improve the quality of plant water flow estimates obtained using sap flow methods, further efforts are needed to develop and follow transparent protocols for each method, including protocols for installation; homogenization of raw data processing, and quantification of uncertainty [see @Richard2020]. Also, calibration of probes is essential whenever possible; otherwise, applying generic or species-specific correction factors for each method may be an alternative solution, although less accurate. To improve method-specific correction factors, it would be important to identify sapwood traits that might explain measurement errors, such as wood density, or anatomical and vessel distribution traits [@Suleiman1999; @Wullschleger2011]. However, so far attempts to identify the potential effect of those wood traits on sap flow measurement errors have not been entirely successful [@Peters2018, Chapter 2], possibly due to the fact that the actual traits are rarely measured on the same plant material used in the calibrations. Studying these wood traits in the context of sap flow calibrations for a range of species with different sapwood anatomies would allow us to understand their potential influence on sap flow measurement uncertainty, and to obtain correction factors for all species without the need for calibration. Besides, scaling of single-point measurements to the whole-tree level constitutes another major source of uncertainty [@Hernandez-Santana2015] that cannot be easily addressed with correction factors. Sap flow integration requires to consider the tree sapwood area and its radial profile, whose quantification carries a lot of uncertainty even with destructive tree sampling [@Hernandez-Santana2015]. Nonetheless, the scaling error could be minimized by taking more than several sap flow measurements along the perimeter and radial profile of the plant, and estimating sapwood area more accurately by using on-site robust species allometrical relationships or multiple core samples of the measured individuals.\par

Improving the accuracy of sap flow methods has been a major research goal for decades. For this purpose, specific corrections have been implemented, for example, for dealing with wounding effects or for fixing signal dampening due to installation time [@Green2003; @Swanson1981; @Peters2018]. In addition, new probes configurations and sap flow techniques have been developed. Some of the technologies currently being designed are promising, such as those based on dual techniques applying different methods throughout the flow range [@Forster_2019], on single-probe methods to minimize wound [@Lopez-Bernal2017], or on developing integrated, compact and low cost systems [@jones_ribbonized_2020]. Besides the traditional thermometric methods, some attempts have been made using other approaches such as acoustic emissions [@Cern2011; @Mazal2012], or thermal imaging [@Anfodillo1993], but they have not been entirely successful. Despite the uncertainties associated to all thermometric sap flow methods, they remain the best tool we have at hand to estimate transpiration dynamics at the tree-level, and the only solid basis for the compilation of a global sap flow database [@Poyatos2016].\par

##The SAPLUXNET database. What next?

Over the course of the thesis, the SAPFLUXNET database has become a reality [@poyatos_global_2020], and it is currently available and open access at ZENODO [@rafael_poyatos_2020] since 2019. Additionally, we have built a data infrastructure capable of processing and analysing large amounts of sap flow related data, which is prepared for the inclusion of new data sets if further requests for data contributions are reopened in the future. SAPFLUXNET has gained increased attention from ecophysiologists and ecohydrologists, and by the end of 2020 there have been around 1500 downloads of the data base. As discussed in Chapter 3, SAPFLUXNET and its combination with existing datasets, such as FLUXNET [@Pastorello2020] or HydraTRY [@mencuccini_leaf_2019; @SanchezMartinez2020] or remote sensing products such as GLEAM [@Martens2017], will help us to better characterize plant drought responses and forest transpiration across the globe. Also, in conjunction with, for example, the Tree-Ring Data Bank [@Henri1997] or remote sensing data [@simard_mapping_2011], SAPFLUXNET will improve the characterization of drought legacy effects and recovery of water use after drought, potentially bridging the gap between water use, tree growth and ecosystem productivity. This thesis is an example of the kind of studies that can be accomplished taking advantage of SAPFLUXNET. In particular, I carried out the first quantification of the importance of hydroclimatic drivers controlling tree transpiration globally, and also characterized tree water use strategies across species that emerge from the covariation between water use regulation and hydraulic traits.\par


##The hydroclimatic drivers of transpiration and their complexity

The closure of stomata to prevent water loss through transpiration responds to hydroclimatic changes at temporal scales that range from minutes to seasons [@Buckley2005]. As a result, plant transpiration is coupled to some extent to hydroclimatic variables (i.e. vapour pressure deficit, soil water content and radiation). This coupling allows plants to cope with drought, and may differ depending on environmental conditions, water use strategy and legacy effects. I have shown in this thesis that vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is the main driver of transpiration globally. This result may be explained by the different temporal scale at which changes in VPD, soil water content (SWC) and radiation occur. Stomatal closure might be tightly and promptly coupled to VPD to protect plant hydraulic integrity under abrupt dry atmospheric conditions, while the dynamics of soil moisture supply are slower, allowing to maintain transpiration rates by, for example, exploring and extracting water from deeper layers of the soil as drought progresses [@barbeta_relative_2017]. By contrast, although radiation (PPFD) has similar temporal scale dynamics as VPD, it is less coupled to plant transpiration. This may be explained by the direct relationship of the VPD with water flows and plant water status, especially in well-coupled canopies, while the function of PPFD as a *G* driver would be a more complex process produced via photosynthesis. This direct effect can be found in most ecosystem-level *G* models which show better results using only VPD [@lin_diel_2018], although VPD and solar radiation are strongly coupled at most temporal scales.\par

The lack of coupling between transpiration dynamics and hydrometeorological variables in drylands suggested by our results might be related to complex responses of transpiration regulation to the interaction of the hydrometeorological drivers [@zhou_projected_2019], which we have not considered explicitly. Alternatively, it might be associated to the diversity of water use strategies in water limited systems that allow plants living in dry biomes to escape from drought dynamics and better compete for resources and maximize growth. These water use strategies may be related to multiple anatomical and hydraulic traits conferring drought tolerance and safety towards hydraulic failure, which is in concordance with results in Chapter 5.\par

The low variance explained by VPD, SWC and PPFD in some regions limits our ability to explain (and model) transpiration patterns at the global scale. An additional reason for this low explanatory power may be the simple shape of the log models of canopy conductance used in Chapter 4 -although similar explained variance was obtained by more flexible GAM models-, which may fail for some species or sites, especially for the SWC models. Thus, it would be important to further test whether the empirical couplings reported in this thesis are similar to those predicted by the main stomatal regulation algorithms used by land surface models [@mencuccinimodelling2019]. In addition, other ecohydrological variables not considered in Chapter 4 could also explain transpiration regulation, such as wind speed or [$\text{CO}_2$]. Finally, this thesis evidences large differences in transpiration responses to hydroclimatic drivers across species and sites. The possibility to explain these differences using measurable plant traits opens new ground towards the characterization and modelling of plant water use strategies at the global scale, a topic that I address in the final empirical chapter of the thesis (Chapter 5).\par

##On the use of plant traits to characterize water use strategies at the global level

A better understanding of the spatial distribution of tree water use strategies will allow the improvement of climate and ecosystem models, particularly in drought-prone situations [@Matheny2017]. Static parameters defining water use strategies for plant functional types (PFT) used in current terrestrial biosphere and dynamic vegetation models have been identified as a potential source of uncertainty due to PFT over-aggregation [@Wullschleger2014; @Yang2015]. Moving to a trait-based approach would therefore improve our capacity to predict ecosystem responses, since for each parameter used in the models there would be a continuum set of trait values, one corresponding to each species (or even, potentially, to each population). Results from Chapter 5 show that plant traits related to water transport (hydraulics) and water relations explain water use regulation by plants, particularly regarding responses to VPD. These results pave the ground for the inclusion of these traits in land surface models [as already done in some cases: @Kennedy2019; @Eller2020] and for the use of these traits in up-scaling water use from the tree to the ecosystem in diverse communities. However, as shown in Chapter 4, our predictive capacity of transpiration regulation at the daily level is still relatively low for some regions, and it would be interesting to explore different temporal scales and also consider more complex models.\par

Following results shown in Chapter 5 and in concordance to the postulated trade-off between hydraulic safety and efficiency, trees with high water transport capacity (e.g., large xylem conduits) would tend to be more vulnerable to hydraulic dysfunction (e.g., high vulnerability to xylem embolism) and therefore would show a tight stomatal regulation to protect their hydraulic system [@Taneda2008]. In contrast, species less conductive species with safer conduits would tend to have a less strict stomatal regulation. However, there are several examples of trees with high conductive capacity in the xylem and relatively loose stomatal regulation [@martinez-vilalta_new_2014], which implies that other traits rather than xylem properties might be determining the water use strategy [@matheny_observations_2015]. These considerations suggest, as we have explored in Chapter 5, that water-use strategies at the tree level emerge from the coordination of different traits, and can only be understood if this coordination is explicitly taken into account.\par

Other traits would potentially be useful for describing water use strategies in addition to the hydraulic and anatomical traits explored in this thesis, in addition to the effects of climate, soil and stand structure properties (Chapter 4). Many functional traits have been recognized as important determinants of plant ecological strategies [@Yang2015], including specific leaf area or seed mass, which may link the plant economic spectrum hypothesis to plant hydraulics and water use strategies [@rosas_torrent_integrating_2019]. Another important consideration is that, in order to implement this trait-based approach to define water use strategies that can be applied to land surface models, it is essential that these traits are mapped at a global scale. Global to regional maps of plant traits are currently limited to a small group of leaf [@moreno-martinez_methodology_2018] or hydraulic [@trugman_trait_2020] traits. However, recent studies highlighting the strong phylogenetic conservatism of key hydraulic traits [@SanchezMartinez2020], together with the increased availability of tree distribution data [@serra-diaz_big_2017], suggest that global maps for these traits will be available soon.\par

##Towards a global characterization of plant water use strategies.

In the present thesis we have explored plant water use from the perspective of whole-tree transpiration regulation in response to concomitant variations in hydrometeorological forcing. However, we have left out important aspects to understand and define the water use strategies of trees. For instance, in Chapter 5 we focus on xylem hydraulics without explicitly considering the hydraulics of leaves and roots, which are important determinants of plants’ water status and the drought sensitivity of whole-plant hydraulic conductance. Accounting for these different organs will help integrate the internal and external conditions that regulate transpiration and define water use strategies, and to better understand the link between plant economic spectrum, hydraulic safety and efficiency and the regulation of plant water status [@reich_world-wide_2014, @martinez-vilalta_water_2017]. This would be facilitated by building an additional database for SAPFLUXNET sites with available measured midday and pre-down leaf water potentials, which combined with midday sap flow data would allow to estimate whole-tree hydraulic conductance [@eller_using_2018]. Most current models estimate whole-tree hydraulic conductance from branch-level xylem hydraulic conductance, either directly or applying a simple upscaling exercise based on conduit tapering [e.g., @Christoffersen2016; @Eller2020], which is likely to be inaccurate and biased across species. Besides, to complement the study of transpiration responses, high resolution dendrometric measures would allow to estimate the role of steam capacitance in water use strategies [@Steppe2015]. There is still much to be understood about tree water use strategies and the drivers of transpiration regulation. This is in part due to the lack of high quality data for an adequate parametrization of transpiration dynamics at relevant spatiotemporal scales. The use of the SAPFLUXNET global database represents a major step forward and a powerful tool to overcome this challenge to a significant extent.\par

##Conclusions

- 2.1. Calibrations of sap flow methods shows large intra- and inter-method variability in performance, with a low proportion of this variability explained by species and no consistent effects of wood density or porosity type.\par
-	2.2. Dissipation methods showed lower accuracy and higher proportional bias than other methods, but relatively high linearity and precision, while Pulse methods also showed significant proportional bias driven by their overestimation of low flows. Therefore, Dissipation methods may be more appropriate to assess relative sap flow and Pulse methods may be more suitable to quantify medium and high absolute flows.\par
-	2.3. All sap flow methods showed high precision, justifying their use to quantify environmental responses of transpiration and allowing potential correction of the measurements using study-specific calibrations.\par
-	3.1. We present the global SAPFLUXNET database, inclusing harmonised and quality-controlled individual datasets supplied by contributors worldwide. Datasets include sub-daily time series of sap flow and hydrometeorological drivers for 202 globally distributed sites, including 2714 trees belonging to 174 species.\par
-	3.2. The SAPFLUXNET database provides the first global perspective of water use by individual plants at multiple timescales, with important applications in fields ranging from plant ecophysiology to Earth-system science.\par
-	4.1. Transpiration regulation is better explained by vapour pressure deficit (VPD) than by soil water content (SWC) or radiation (PPFD). Trees in dryland biomes are less coupled to all three hydrometeorological drivers than those in other biomes.\par
-	4.2. Climate, soil and vegetation structure were common controls of all three hydrometereological couplings with canopy conductance, with wetter climates, fine textured soils and tall vegetation being associated to tighter coupling.\par
-	5.1. Reference canopy conductance and its sensitivity to VPD is coordinated with hydraulic and allocation traits (i.e. $\Psi_{\text{P50}}$, $K_{\text{s}}$, Hv, $\Psi_{\text{TLP}}$, $R_{\text{depth}}$, $L_{\text{s}}$ and tree height) rather than being directly controlled by climate (e.g, mean annual precipitation).\par
-	5.2. Species with efficient xylem transport (higher hydraulic conductance) had higher canopy conductance but also higher sensitivity to VPD. Moreover, we found that angiosperms had higher reference canopy conductance and higher sensitivity to VPD than gymnosperms.\par
